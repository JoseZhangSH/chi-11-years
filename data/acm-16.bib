abstract = {Taxonomies are a useful and ubiquitous way of organizing information. However, creating
organizational hierarchies is difficult because the process requires a global understanding
of the objects to be categorized. Usually one is created by an individual or a small
group of people working together for hours or even days. Unfortunately, this centralized
approach does not work well for the large, quickly changing datasets found on the
web. Cascade is an automated workflow that allows crowd workers to spend as little
at 20 seconds each while collectively making a taxonomy. We evaluate Cascade and show
that on three datasets its quality is 80-90% of that of experts. Cascade has a competitive
cost to expert information architects, despite taking six times more human labor.
Fortunately, this labor can be parallelized such that Cascade will run in as fast
as four minutes instead of hours or days.},

we know little about how these teams form and what leads to their ultimate success.
Building on theories of social identity and exchange, we present an exploratory study

data using a novel path-based regression model that accurately predicts and reveals
key variables about collab formation. Combined with a large-scale survey of members,
we find that communication, nuanced complementary interest and status, and a balanced
effort from both parties contribute to successful collaborations. We also discuss
several applications of these findings for socio-technical infrastructures that support

contributes an understanding of how virtual interactions and practices can be developed
to complement existing practices of experienced birders in the physical world. In

on the difficult task of captioning speech in real-time. Prior work has shown that
the crowd can collectively caption speech in real-time by merging the partial results
of multiple workers. Because non-expert workers cannot keep up with natural speaking
rates, the task is frustrating and prone to errors as workers buffer what they hear
to type later. The TimeWarp approach automatically increases and decreases the speed
of speech playback systematically across individual workers who caption only the periods
played at reduced speed. Studies with 139 remote crowd workers and 24 local participants
show that this approach improves median coverage (14.8%), precision (11.2%), and per-word
latency (19.1%). Warping time may also help crowds outperform individuals on other
difficult real-time performance tasks.},

measure the perceived visual complexity and colorfulness of website screenshots. In
combination with demographic variables such as a user's education level and age, these
models explain approximately half of the variance in the ratings of aesthetic appeal
given after viewing a website for 500ms only.},

abstract = {Colours are an important part of user experiences on the Web. Colour schemes influence
the aesthetics, first impressions and long-term engagement with websites. However,
five percent of people perceive a subset of all colours because they have colour vision
deficiency (CVD), resulting in an unequal and less-rich user experience on the Web.
Traditionally, people with CVD have been supported by recolouring tools that improve
colour differentiability, but do not consider the subjective properties of colour
schemes while recolouring. To address this, we developed SPRWeb, a tool that recolours
websites to preserve subjective responses and improve colour differentiability - thus
enabling users with CVD to have similar online experiences. To develop SPRWeb, we
extended existing models of non-CVD subjective responses to CVD, then used this extended
model to steer the recolouring process. In a lab study, we found that SPRWeb did significantly
better than a standard recolouring tool at preserving the temperature and naturalness
of websites, while achieving similar weight and differentiability preservation. We
also found that recolouring did not preserve activity, and hypothesize that visual
complexity influences activity more than colour. SPRWeb is the first tool to automatically
preserve the subjective and perceptual properties of website colour schemes thereby
equalizing the colour-based web experience for people with CVD.},

We analyze the content and structure of 691 user-generated narratives on positive
and negative experiences with technology. We use a multi-method approach consisting
of manual (structural analysis of narratives) as well as of automated content analysis
methods (psycholinguistic analysis and machine learning). These analyses show converging
evidence that positive narratives predominantly concern social aspects such as family
and friends. In addition, technology is positively experienced when it enables users
to do things more efficiently or in a new way. In contrast, negative narratives often
express anger and frustration due to technological failures. Our multi-method approach
illustrates the potential of automated (as opposed to manual) content analysis methods
for studying text-based experience reports.},

were .82 and .83 -- excellent for a two-item instrument. Concurrent validity was also
high, with significant correlation with the SUS (.81, .81) and with likelihood-to-recommend
(LTR) scores (.74, .73). The scores were sensitive to respondents' frequency-of-use.
UMUX-LITE score means were slightly lower than those for the SUS, but easily adjusted
using linear regression to match the SUS scores. Due to its parsimony (two items),
reliability, validity, structural basis (usefulness and usability) and, after applying
the corrective regression formula, its correspondence to SUS scores, the UMUX-LITE
appears to be a promising alternative to the SUS when it is not desirable to use a

abstract = {The number of available mobile applications is steadily increasing. People have rapidly
adopted application stores as means to customize their devices with various functionalities
that go beyond communication. Understanding the principles of mobile application usage
is crucial for supporting users within this new ecosystem. In this paper, we investigate
how people organize applications they have installed on their devices. We asked more
than 130 participants for their habits for icon arrangement and collected more than
1,400 screenshots of their devices' menus to further ground our findings. Based on
this data we can distinguish five different concepts for arranging icons on smartphone
menus, e.g. based on application usage frequency and applications' functional relatedness.
Additionally, we investigated how these concepts emerge in relation to frequency of
application installations, removals and icon rearrangements, as well as users' experience
levels. Finally we discuss implications for the design of smartphone launchers, and
highlight differences to icon arrangement on stationary computers.},

a new mixed interaction system based on Anoto, video projection, and tracking. Starting
from the understanding of the benefits of tangible paper strips, our goal is to study
how mixed physical and virtual augmented data can support the controllers' mental
work. The context of the activity led us to depart from models that are proposed in
tangible interfaces research where coherence is based on how physical objects are
representative of virtual objects. We propose a new account of coherence in a mixed
interaction system that integrates externalization mechanisms. We found that physical
objects play two roles: they act both as representation of mental objects and as tangible
artifacts for interacting with augmented features. We observed that virtual objects
represent physical ones, and not the reverse, and, being virtual representations of
physical objects, should seamlessly converge with the cognitive role of the physical
object. Finally, we show how coherence is achieved by providing a seamless interactive
space.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of how to extend the capabilities of a well-established
interface in a way that respects users' existing expertise. The piano-style keyboard
is among the most widely used and versatile of digital musical interfaces. However,
it lacks the ability to alter the pitch of a note after it has been played, a limitation
which prevents the performer from executing common expressive techniques including
vibrato and pitch bending. We present a system for controlling pitch from the keyboard
surface using capacitive touch sensors to measure the locations of the player's fingers
on the keys. The large community of trained pianists makes the keyboard a compelling
target for augmentation, but it also poses a challenge: how can a musical interface
be extended while making use of the existing techniques performers have spent thousands
of hours learning? In this paper, user studies with conservatory pianists explore
the constraints of traditional keyboard technique and evaluate the usability of the
continuous pitch control system. The paper also discusses implications for the extension
of other established interfaces in musical and non-musical contexts.},

abstract = {Loop pedals are real-time samplers that playback audio played previously by a musician.
Such pedals are routinely used for music practice or outdoor "busking". However, loop
pedals always playback the same material, which can make performances monotonous and
boring both to the musician and the audience, preventing their widespread uptake in
professional concerts. In response, we propose a new approach to loop pedals that
addresses this issue, which is based on an analytical multi-modal representation of
the audio input. Instead of simply playing back prerecorded audio, our system enables
real-time generation of an audio accompaniment reacting to what is currently being
performed by the musician. By combining different modes of performance - e.g. bass
line, chords, solo - from the musician and system automatically, solo musicians can
perform duets or trios with themselves, without engendering the so-called canned (boringly
repetitive and unresponsive) music effect of loop pedals. We describe the technology,
based on supervised classification and concatenative synthesis, and then illustrate
our approach on solo performances of jazz standards by guitar. We claim this approach
opens up new avenues for concert performance.},

The main finding across these studies is that place trumps space: a conducive social
context could overcome a poor physical space and encourage interaction; conversely,
an inappropriate social context could inhibit interaction in spaces that might normally
facilitate engagement. We discuss this finding in terms of the salience of the display
within the space, the visibility of incidental interactions with the installation,
the different understandings of place that people can have in the same location and
the role of emergent champions and comperes in encouraging interaction.},

the degree to which previous commercial products and research prototypes can be considered
as fitting the focused-casual framework, and describe the properties using control

of latency on the performance of tasks common to direct-touch interfaces, such as
direct physical manipulation.In this paper, we study the effect of latency of a direct-touch
pointing device on dragging tasks. Our tests show that user performance decreases
as latency increases. We also find that user performance is more severely affected
by latency when targets are smaller or farther away. We present a detailed analysis
of users' coping mechanisms for latency, and present the results of a follow-up study
demonstrating user perception of latency in the land-on phase of the dragging task.},

We consider the tradeoffs between two versions of a UI for working with data on a
touch tablet. One interface is based on using the conventional desktop metaphor (WIMP)
with a control panel, push buttons, and checkboxes -- where the mouse click is effectively
replaced by a finger tap. The other interface (which we call FLUID) eliminates the
control panel and focuses touch actions on the data visualization itself. We describe
our design process and evaluation of each interface. We discuss the significantly
better task performance and preference for the FLUID interface, in particular how
touch design may challenge certain assumptions about the performance benefits of WIMP
interfaces that do not hold on touch devices, such as the superiority of gestural
vs. control panel based interaction.},

files, yet it can be slow and repetitive. New algorithms that predict upcoming file
accesses have the potential to improve navigation-based file retrieval, but it is
unknown how best to present their predictions to users. We present three design goals
aiming to improve navigation-based file retrieval interfaces: minimise the time spent
at each hierarchical level en route to the target file; reduce the number of levels
traversed by providing shortcuts; and promote rehearsal of the retrieval mechanics
to facilitate expertise. We introduce three interfaces that augment standard file
browsers based on each of these goals: Icon Highlights give greater prominence to
predicted items in the current folder; Hover Menus provide shortcuts to predicted
folder content; and Search Directed Navigation uses predictive highlighting to guide
users through the hierarchy in response to query terms. Results from a user evaluation
show that all three interfaces improve file retrieval times, with Icon Highlights
and Hover Menus best suited for frequently accessed items and Search Directed Navigation
best suited for infrequent ones. We also show that the benefits are larger when folder
content is spatially unstable. Finally, we discuss how the interfaces could be combined
and deployed in existing file browsers.},

of structured data currently becoming available. In this study, we conducted an exploratory,
sequential, mixed-method investigation, starting with two pre-studies of the data
integration needs and challenges, respectively, of Web-based data sources. Observations
from these pre-studies led to DataPalette, an interface that introduced simple co-reference
and group multi-path-selection mechanisms for working with terminologically and structurally
heterogeneous data. Our lab study showed that participants readily understood the
new interaction mechanisms which were introduced. Participants made more carefully
justified decisions, even while weighing a greater number of factors, moreover expending
less effort, during subjective-choice tasks when using DataPalette, than with a control

Participants had a higher tendency to select peer user opinions in topics that they
had low than high involvement, but only when there was no perception of threat. Overall,
participants' attitudes were moderated after being exposed to diverse views, although
high topic involvement led to higher resistance to such moderation. Perceived threat
also weakened attitude moderation, especially for low involvement topics. Results
have important implication to the potential effects of "information bubble" - selective

In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants
simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts.
We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change
existing passwords on "important" accounts and that individual meter design decisions
likely have a marginal impact.},

While performance declined, our results show that BoD Shapes can be very fast (up
to 1.5 seconds in the user study) and that learning effects have an influence on its
performance. This indicates that speed improvements can be expected in long-term use.},

abstract = {Number entry is a common task in many domains. In safety-critical environments such
as air traffic control or on hospital wards, incorrect number entry can have serious
harmful consequences. Research has investigated how interface designs can help prevent
users from making number entry errors. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation
of two possible interface designs aimed at helping users detect number entry errors
using the idea of a checksum: an additional (redundant) number that is related to
the to-be-entered numbers in such a way that it is sufficient to verify the correctness
of the checksum, as opposed to checking each of the entered numbers. The first interface
requires users to check their own work with the help of the checksum; the second requires
the user to enter the checksum along with the other numbers so that the system can
do the checking. In each case, two numbers needed to be entered, while the third number
served as a checksum. With the first interface, users caught only 36% of their errors.
The second interface resulted in all errors being caught, but the need to enter the
checksum increased entry time by 46%. When participants were allowed to choose between
the two interfaces, they chose the second interface in only 12% of the cases. Although
these results cannot be generalized to other specific contexts, the results illustrate
the strengths and weaknesses of each way of using checksums to catch number entry
errors. Hence our study can serve as a starting point for efforts to improve each
method.},

people's selection of news articles? This paper reports on results from two experiments
looking at social annotations in two different news reading contexts. The first experiment
simulates a logged-out experience with annotations from strangers, a computer agent,
and a branded company. Results indicate that, perhaps unsurprisingly, annotations
by strangers have no persuasive effects. However, surprisingly, unknown branded companies
still had a persuasive effect. The second experiment simulates a logged-in experience
with annotations from friends, finding that friend annotations are both persuasive
and improve user satisfaction over their article selections. In post-experiment interviews,
we found that this increased satisfaction is due partly because of the context that
annotations add. That is, friend annotations both help people decide what to read,
and provide social context that improves engagement. Interviews also suggest subtle
expertise effects. We discuss implications for design of social annotation systems
and suggestions for future research.},

design of group shopping sites map to the real shopping needs of end users. To address
this, we describe an interview study that investigates the friendship networks of
people who participate in group shopping sites (e.g., Groupon) with the goal of understanding
how to best design for these experiences. Our results show that group shopping sites
are predominently used to support social activities; that is, users do not use them
first and foremost to find 'deals'. Instead, group shopping sites are used for planning
group activities, extending and building friendships, and constructing one's social
identity. Based on these findings, we suggest improved social network integration
and impression management tools to improve user experience within group shopping sites.},

to maintain relationships, as well as loci of intense research interest. Recently,
a new site has exploded into prominence: Pinterest became the fastest social network
to reach 10M users, growing 4000% in 2011 alone. While many Pinterest articles have
appeared in the popular press, there has been little scholarly work so far. In this
paper, we use a quantitative approach to study three research questions about the
site. What drives activity on Pinterest? What role does gender play in the site's
social connections? And finally, what distinguishes Pinterest from existing networks,
in particular Twitter? In short, we find that being female means more repins, but
fewer followers, and that four verbs set Pinterest apart from Twitter: use, look,
want and need. This work serves as an early snapshot of Pinterest that later work
can leverage.},

years have seen an increase in games designed for changing human behaviors or attitudes.
However, these games are limited in two major ways: first, they are not based on theories
of what motivates healthy behavior change. This makes it difficult to evaluate why
a persuasive approach works. Second, most persuasive games treat players as a monolithic
group. As an attempt to resolve these weaknesses, we conducted a large-scale survey
of 642 gamers' eating habits and their associated determinants of healthy behavior
to understand how health behavior relates to gamer type. We developed seven different
models of healthy eating behavior for the gamer types identified by BrainHex. We then
explored the differences between the models and created two approaches for effective
persuasive game design based on our results. The first is a one-size-fits-all approach
that will motivate the majority of the population, while not demotivating any players.
The second is a personalized approach that will best motivate a particular type of
gamer. Finally, to make our approaches actionable in persuasive game design, we map
common game mechanics to the determinants of healthy behavior.},

abstract = {In an era of 108% annual growth in demand for mobile data and $10/GB overage fees,
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are experiencing severe congestion and in turn are
hurting consumers with aggressive pricing measures. But smarter practices, such as
time-dependent pricing (TDP), reward users for shifting their non-critical demand
to off-peak hours and can potentially benefit both users and ISPs. Although dynamic
TDP ideas have existed for many years, dynamic pricing for mobile data is only now
gaining interest among ISPs. Yet TDP plans require not only systems engineering but
also an understanding of economic incentives, user behavior and interface design.
In particular, the HCI aspects of communicating price feedback signals from the network
and the response of mobile data users need to be studied in the real world. But investigating
these issues by deploying a virtual TDP data plan for real ISP customers is challenging
and rarely explored. To this end, we carried out the first TDP trial for mobile data
in the US with 10 families. We describe the insights gained from the trial, which
can help the HCI community as well as ISPs, app developers and designers create tools
that empower users to better control their usage and save on their monthly bills,
while also alleviating network congestion.},

paper, we investigate users' experiences of display advertising on mobile devices.
We consider three factors that are often studied in desktop settings the ad's level
of personal relevance to the user, its relevance to the page content, and within-ad
properties, with a particular focus on the level of animation in the ad. Our findings
reveal a few surprises. First, personal relevance to the user has little or no impact
on ad efficacy measured by recall. Instead, content relevance boosts ad recall. Second,
user relevance leads to a more pleasant and interesting experience, but content relevance
has no effect. Third, contrary to the popular notion that animation often leads to
more effective ads by garnering more user attention, we find that a simple type of
animation, such as blinking animation, negatively affects user experience and reduces
ad recall. Our findings, while focused on advertising, offer insights for design of
mobile content presentation in general.},

abstract = {We propose using spatial gestures not only for input but also for output. Analogous
to gesture input, the proposed gesture output moves the user's finger in a gesture,
which the user then recognizes. We use our concept in a mobile scenario where a motion
path forming a "5" informs users about new emails, or a heart-shaped path serves as
a mes- sage from a friend. We built two prototypes: (1) The long- RangeOuija is a
stationary prototype that offers a motion range of up to 4cm; (2) The pocketOuija
is self-contained mobile device based on an iPhone with up to 1cm motion range. Both
devices actuate the user's fingers by means of an actuated transparent foil overlaid
onto a touchscreen. We conducted three studies with the longRangeOuija in which participants
recognized 2cm marks with 97% accu- racy, Graffiti digits with 98.8%, pairs of Graffiti
digits with 90.5%, and Graffiti letters with 93.4%. Participants previ- ously unfamiliar
with Graffiti identified 96.2% of digits and 76.4% of letters, suggesting that properly
designed gesture output is guessable. After the experiment, the same participants
were able to enter 100% of Graffiti digits by heart and 92.2% of letters. This suggests
that participants learned gesture input as a side effect of using gesture output on
our prototypes.},

conversion models with clear understandings of their perceptual consequences. Our
current implementation is tailored to accurate detection of special sound effects
to provide well-synchronized audio-tactile feedback in immersive applications. We
also assessed the performance of our translation algorithm in terms of the detection
rate of special sound effects, computational performance, and user preference. All
the experimental results supported that our algorithm works well as intended with
better performance than the signal-level conversion methods, especially for games.
Our algorithm can be easily realized in current products, including mobile devices,
gaming devices, and 4D home theater systems, for richer user experience.},

obtain substantially smaller and more energy-efficient devices. We present a prototype
that fits on the back of a mobile phone. It actuates users' forearm muscles via four
electrodes, which causes users' muscles to contract involuntarily, so that they tilt
the device sideways. As users resist this motion using their other arm, they perceive
force feedback. We demonstrate the interaction at the example of an interactive videogame
in which users steer an airplane through winds rendered using force feedback. In a
first user study, we found our device to cause users to produce up to 18.7N of force,
when used to actuate their palm flexors. In a second study, participants played the
video game de-scribed above; all ten participants reported to prefer the experience
of muscle-propelled force feedback to vibrotactile feedback.},

abstract = {We present LaserOrigami, a rapid prototyping system that produces 3D objects using
a laser cutter. LaserOrigami is substantially faster than traditional 3D fabrication
techniques such as 3D printing and unlike traditional laser cutting the resulting
3D objects require no manual assembly. The key idea behind LaserOrigami is that it
achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece, rather than
by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly. LaserOrigami
achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until they become compliant
and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers the heat by defocusing
the laser, which distributes the laser's power across a larger surface. LaserOrigami
implements cutting and bending in a single integrated process by automatically moving
the cutting table up and down--when users take out the workpiece, it is already fully
assembled. We present the three main design elements of LaserOrigami: the bend, the
suspender, and the stretch, and demonstrate how to use them to fabricate a range of
physical objects. Finally, we demonstrate an interactive fabrication version of LaserOrigami,
a process in which user interaction and fabrication alternate step-by-step.},

Taking 3D bar charts as an example, we show that moving visualizations to the physical
world can improve users' efficiency at information retrieval tasks. In contrast, augmenting
on-screen visualizations with stereoscopic rendering alone or with prop-based manipulation
was of limited help. The efficiency of physical visualizations seems to stem from
features that are unique to physical objects, such as their ability to be touched
and their perfect visual realism. These findings provide empirical motivation for
current research on fast digital fabrication and self-reconfiguring interfaces.},

drawing back the shaft, while the rest of the time it allows complete gestural freedom.

abstract = {Some organizations fail to involve users in systems development due to a widespread
organization, high workload or secrecy issues. A remedy against this situation could
be the persona method in which users and main stakeholders as represented as fictitious
characters. Personas help eliciting user needs and requirements, facilitate design
choices and are an overall communication aid where users cannot be present. An important
part of the persona method, as portrayed in literature, is the personal details that
make the personas trustworthy and alive. In this paper we present two cases in which
personas have been developed and used, but where the personal is scarce or even non-existent
because of a dispersed organisation, the organisational culture and secrecy issues.
The paper describes how the personas were developed, used and received and how the
method was altered in order to work in these special circumstances.},

major themes for some time in HCI, the core principles have yet to be applied beyond

terms of usage.Using the SMOG readability formula and UK Energy services as a case
study, we observed that a series of supplier terms and conditions were far beyond
what a functionally literate adult could be expected to understand. We also present
a browser based plug-in which compares SMOG readability scores to popular books. The

supports input and output channels that are especially suited for co-located social

we offer low-cost design recommendations that would enable outdated PCs to support
greater shared use and increased utility within the constrained material context of
low-income households. These simple interventions, if adopted by computer refurbishment

by adapting the underlying spatial model to factors such as input hand postures, individuals,

spatial backoff model (SBM) that consists of submodels with different levels of complexity.
The most general model includes no adaptive factors, whereas the most specific model
includes all three. Considering that in practice people may switch hand postures (e.g.,
from two-thumb to one-finger) to better suit a situation, and that the specific submodels
may take time to train for each user, a specific submodel should be applied only if
its corresponding input posture can be identified with confidence, and if the submodel
has enough training data from the user. We introduce the backoff mechanism to fall
back to a simpler model if either of these conditions are not met. We implemented
a prototype system capable of reducing the language-model-independent error rate by
13.2% using an online posture classifier with 86.4% accuracy. Further improvements
in error rate may be possible with even better posture classification.},

May 9, 2012, as of mid-September Polly has spread to 85,000 users, engaging them in
495,000 interactions, and is continuing to spread to 1,000 new people daily. It has
also attracted 27,000 people to a job search service, who in turn listened 279,000
times to job ads and forwarded them 22,000 times to their friends. We report users'
activity over time and across demographics, analyze user behavior within several randomized
controlled trials, and describe lessons learned regarding spread, scalability and

abstract = {One of the greatest challenges in designing applications for economically poor communities
is that potential users may have little or no education. We investigated how limited
education appears to impact the ability to navigate a hierarchical UI, even when it
has no text. We scored 60 participants from low-income communities in India using
tests of textual literacy and Raven's Progressive Matrices. These were used as proxies
for educational level and a subset of cognitive abilities. We then evaluated participants'
performance on a UI task involving hierarchical navigation. First, our results confirm
that textual literacy is correlated with scores on the Raven's test. In addition,
we found that performance on both instruments are predictive of performance in navigating
UI hierarchies, even when the UI is text-free. This provides statistically significant
confirmation of previous anecdotal hypotheses. We conclude with design recommendations
for UI hierarchies for people with limited education.},

We qualitatively studied Facebook use among 28 young adults living in Viwandani, an

associated with Internet use, participants consolidated diverse online activities
onto Facebook; here we focus on the most common practice--using Facebook to support
income generation. Viwandani residents used the site to look for employment opportunities,
market themselves, and seek remittances from friends and family abroad. We use our
findings to motivate a design agenda for the urban poor built on an understanding
that Facebook is used, with mixed-success, to support income generation. A key part
of this agenda calls for developing ICT interventions grounded in users' existing
practices rather than introducing new and unfamiliar ones.},

abstract = {Designing ICT systems for rural users in the developing world is difficult for a variety
of reasons ranging from problems with infrastructure to wide differences in user contexts
and capabilities. Developing regions may include huge variability in spoken languages,
and users are often low- or non-literate, with very little experience interacting
with digital technologies. Researchers have explored the use of text-free graphical
interfaces as well as speech-based applications to overcome some of the issues related
to language and literacy. While there are benefits and drawbacks to each of these
approaches, they can be complementary when used together. In this work, we present
VideoKheti, a mobile system using speech, graphics, and touch interaction for low-literate
farmers in rural India. VideoKheti helps farmers to find and watch agricultural extension
videos in their own language and dialect. In this paper, we detail the design and
development of VideoKheti and report on a field study with 20 farmers in rural India
who were asked to find videos based on a scenario. The results show that farmers could
use VideoKheti, but their success still greatly depended on their education level.
While participants were enthusiastic about using the system, the multimodal interface
did not overcome many obstacles for low-literate users.},

the human. Thus, we establish junctures between their findings and materials, as used
in interaction design in HCI. We discuss McLuhan's claim to focus on new sensory effects
and ways of interaction brought forth by new media. Furthermore, we illustrate how
describing the connections between materials, designers, and users in terms of Latour's
Actor-Networks can be beneficial for interaction design. Finally, we discuss the respective
methodology and its relation to research through design.},

on extended ethnographic study of computational development in ecology, this paper

an ecologist, and to 'do' ecology. We analyze in particular the nature of the field
and field work as a central site of ecological practice and identity; how new computational
developments are remediating this crucial relation; and the emergent vocational values
that new and more computationally-intensive forms of ecology may give rise to.},

to investigate if and how children are able to perform as research collaborators.
Children conducted interviews with other participants, and in doing increased their
knowledge about people close to them, and about themselves. The gained insights were
personal and the used personas proved to be a valuable tool. In the role of researcher,
the children discovered similarities and differences between themselves and others.
Besides gaining valuable insights from their participants, they accessed and shared
their own experiences, so while listening to others, the children got sensitized themselves.
In other words, the current study found that next to gathering more data, "super-sources"
are created when children become research collaborators.},

The design goal dimensions are design space and maturity of design. The technique
dimensions include: cost, portability, technology and physical interaction. Three

the different interview approaches change the nature of information elicited, and
that non-facilitated interaction offers clearer insight into interpretation, both
in terms of the meaning that emerges through, and is, therefore, embodied in the interaction,

We conducted a six-week self-reporting study on smartphone usage in order to investigate

compare the subjects' reports against. Subjects never recorded more than 70% and,
depending on the requested reporting interval, down to less than 40% of actual app
usages. They significantly overestimated how long they used apps. While subjects forgot
self-reports when no automatic reminders were sent, a high reporting frequency was
perceived as uncomfortable and burdensome. Most significantly, self-reporting even
changed the actual app usage of users and hence can lead to deceptive measures if
a study relies on no other data sources.With this contribution, we provide empirical
quantitative long-term data on the reliability of self-reported data collected with
mobile devices. We aim to make researchers aware of the caveats of self-reporting

can emotionally engage users and enhance their experience of discovering nearby POIs
serendipitously in unfamiliar places. The primary contribution of this paper is a
field study, in which we evaluate the performance and emotional engagement of different
types of audio-based cues for directing users' attention to specific POIs. Musicons
and mixed-modality cues performed close to visual and speech cues, and significantly
better than auditory icons, for POI identification while creating a much more pleasant
and engaging user experience. We conclude that cues for POI discovery need not always
be as explicit as the baseline visual cues. Indeed, the most challenging cues, auditory
icons, led to a heightened sense of autonomy.},

titles, URLs, and snippets containing the query keywords and proximal text from landing

be a key factor in these decisions, snippets provide only basic support for orienting
users with landing page content from the search-engine result page (SERP), and no
support during the transition to landing pages or once users reach the page following
a selection decision. As a result, many searchers must employ inefficient strategies
such as skimming and scanning the content of the landing page. In this paper we propose
a novel method, called clickable snippets, to address this shortcoming. Clickable
snippets provide searchers with a direct and actionable link between SERP captions
and landing-page content. We describe a user study comparing clickable snippets with
extant methods of orientation support such as query-term highlighting on the landing
page and thumbnail previews on the SERP. We show that clickable snippets are preferred
by participants, and lead to more effective and efficient searching. Our findings
have implications for the design of the user experience in search systems.},

interaction on handheld tablets regardless of whether the device is alive or in sleep
mode. The technique rests on the close succession of two input events: first a bezel
tap, whose detection by accelerometers will awake an idle tablet almost instantly,
then a screen contact. Field studies confirmed that the probability of this input
sequence occurring by chance is very low, excluding the accidental activation concern.
One experiment examined the optimal size of the vocabulary of commands for all four
regions of the bezel (top, bottom, left, right). Another experiment evaluated two
variants of the technique which both allow two-level selection in a hierarchy of commands,
the initial bezel tap being followed by either two screen taps or a screen slide.
The data suggests that Bezel-Tap Gestures may serve to design large vocabularies of
micro-interactions with a sleeping tablet.},

foraging. Of their foraging, 58% fell into distinct dietary patterns - mostly in patterns

solve certain maintenance tasks correctly. Only Stacksplorer and Blaze, however, were
also able to decrease task completion times, although the Call Hierarchy offers access
to a larger part of the call graph. To investigate if this result was caused by a
change in navigation behavior between the tools, we used a set of predictive models
to create formally comparable descriptions of programmer navigation. The results suggest
that the decrease in task completion times has been caused by Stacksplorer and Blaze
promoting call graph navigation more than the Call Hierarchy tool.},

design tools. This idea is manifest in Webzeitgeist, a platform for large-scale design
mining comprising a repository of over 100,000 Web pages and 100 million design elements.
This paper describes the principles driving design mining, the implementation of the
Webzeitgeist architecture, and the new class of data-driven design applications it
enables.},

abstract = {Agile software teams' frequent releases and fast iterations present a growing need
for rigorous user experience research methods that are faster, lighter-weight, and
more flexible. To this end, we developed the Informal Cognitive Walkthrough (ICW).
This agile research methodology grew organically, over the course of three years,
while working with a very large agile software development team. ICWs involve conducting
one or more Simplified 'Streamlined Cognitive Walkthroughs' (SSCW), followed by one
or more Simplified 'Pluralistic Walkthroughs' (SPW). In this paper, we present the
ICW and provide a real-world example of its application. Preliminary experiences with
the method revealed potential advantages over traditional lab studies, ranging from
more quickly uncovering and fixing usability issues, to a stronger collaboration between
the disciplines, and to acting as a forcing function in aligning diverse engineers
to deliver on a common user goal.},

while still disguising this fact the best when information is delivered visually in
batches (multiple pieces of information at a time) and perform better on both dimensions
if information is delivered while they are not speaking. Interestingly, participants
qualitatively did not prefer this mode as being the easiest to use, preferring modes
that displayed one piece of information at a time.},

the dynamic model of operator overload (DMOO), that takes into account critical events

AA using critical events and attention allocation, informed by eye movements. We compared
the DMOO with an inaccurate automation invocation system and a system that invoked
AA based only on critical events. Fewer errors were made with DMOO than with the inaccurate
system. In the critical event condition, where automation was invoked at an earlier
point in time, there were more memory and planning errors, while for the DMOO condition,
which invocated automation at a later point in time, there were more perceptual errors.
These findings provide a framework for reducing specific types of errors through different
automation invocation.},

Specifically, the paper describes how computational cognitive models can be used to
predict the complex interactions among several vehicles driving in a line when one

The results of simulating two distinct car-following scenarios illustrate that in-vehicle
interaction by one driver can have significant downstream effects on other drivers,
especially with respect to speed deviations relative to a lead vehicle. This work
generalizes recent work developing computational evaluation tools for user interfaces
in complex domains, and further serves as an example of how user interaction in some
domains can have broader effects on the community at large.},

abstract = {Relative spatial consistency - that is, the stable arrangement of objects in a 2D
presentation - provides several benefits for interactive interfaces. Spatial consistency
allows users to develop memory of object locations, reducing the time needed for visual
search, and because spatial memory is long lasting and has a large capacity these
performance benefits are enduring and scalable. This suggests that spatial consistency
could be used as a fundamental principle for the design of interfaces. However, there
are many display situations where the standard presentation is altered in some way:
e.g., a window is moved to a new location, scaled, or rotated on a mobile or tabletop
display. It is not known whether the benefits of spatial organization are robust to
these common kinds of view transformation. To assess these effects, we tested user
performance with a spatial interface that had been transformed in several ways, including
different degrees of translation, rotation, scaling, and perspective change. We found
that performance was not strongly affected by the changes, except in the case of large
rotations. To demonstrate the value of spatial consistency over existing mechanisms
for dealing with view changes, we compared user performance with a spatially-stable
presentation (using scaling) with that of a 'reflowing' presentation (widely used
in current interfaces). This study showed that spatial stability with scaling dramatically
outperforms reflowing. This research provides new evidence of spatial consistency's
value in interface design: it is robust to the view transformations that occur in
typical environments, and it provides substantial performance advantages over traditional
methods.},

This technique attaches a small view of an off-view object, including some surrounding
context, to the external boundary of the detail view. The area between the detail
view and the region containing the off-view object is virtually "folded" to conserve
space. A comparison study was conducted contrasting the benefits and limitations of
Canyon to an established technique, called Wedge. Canyon was more accurate across
a number of tasks, especially more complex tasks, and was comparably efficient.},

interfere with staff ability to collect in situ data, and existing technology for
data collection is inadequate. We also identified opportunities for technology to
improve sharing and use of data. We found that data sheets are idiosyncratic and not
useful without human mediation; improved communication with parents could benefit
children's development; and staff are willing, and even eager, to incorporate technology.

abstract = {The increasing rates of diagnosis for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) have brought
unprecedented attention to these conditions. Interventions during childhood can increase
the likelihood of independent living later in life, but most adults with ASDs who
benefited from early intervention do not live independently. There is a need for novel
therapies and interventions that can help children with ASDs develop the social skills
necessary to live independently. Since the launch of the iPad, there has been a great
deal of excitement in the autism community about multitouch tablets and their possible
use in interventions. There are hundreds of apps listed as possibly helping children
with ASDs, yet there is little empirical evidence that any of them have positive effects.
In this paper we present a study on the use of a set of apps from Open Autism Software
at an afterschool program for children with ASDs. The apps are designed to naturally
encourage positive social interactions through creative, expressive, and collaborative
activities. The study compared activities conducted with the apps to similar activities
conducted without the apps. We video recorded the activities, and coded children's
behavior. We found that during the study children spoke more sentences, had more verbal
interactions, and were more physically engaged with the activities when using the
apps. We also found that children made more supportive comments during activities
conducted with two of the apps. The results suggest the approach to using apps evaluated
in this paper can increase positive social interactions in children with ASDs.},

abstract = {Building social support networks is crucial both for less-independent individuals
with autism and for their primary caregivers. In this paper, we describe a four-week
exploratory study of a social network service (SNS) that allows young adults with
autism to garner support from their family and friends. We explore the unique benefits
and challenges of using SNSs to mediate requests for help or advice. In particular,
we examine the extent to which specialized features of an SNS can engage users in
communicating with their network members to get advice in varied situations. Our findings
indicate that technology-supported communication particularly strengthened the relationship
between the individual and extended network members, mitigating concerns about over-reliance
on primary caregivers. Our work identifies implications for the design of social networking
services tailored to meet the needs of this special needs population.},

Two prominent approaches are reduced line charts (RLC), which display small multiples
for time series, and the more recent horizon graphs (HG). We propose to unify RLC
and HG using a new technique - interactive horizon graphs (IHG) - which uses pan and
zoom interaction to increase the number of time series that can be analysed in parallel.
In a user study we compared RLC, HG, and IHG across several tasks and numbers of time
series, focusing on datasets with both large scale and small scale variations. Our
results show that IHG outperform the other two techniques in complex comparison and
matching tasks where the number of charts is large. In the hardest task PHG have a
significantly higher number of good answers (correctness) than HG (+14%) and RLC (+51%)
and a lower error magnitude than HG (-64%) and RLC (-86%).},

different temporal glyph designs in a small multiple setting. Analyzing many time
series at once is a common yet difficult task in many domains, for example in network
monitoring. Several visualization techniques have, thus, been proposed in the literature.
Among these, iconic displays or glyphs are an appropriate choice because of their
expressiveness and effective use of screen space. Through a controlled experiment,
we compare the performance of four glyphs that use different combinations of visual
variables to encode two properties of temporal data: a) the position of a data point
in time and b) the quantitative value of this data point. Our results show that depending
on tasks and data density, the chosen glyphs performed differently. Line Glyphs are
generally a good choice for peak and trend detection tasks but radial encodings are
more effective for reading values at specific temporal locations. From our qualitative
analysis we also contribute implications for designing temporal glyphs for small multiple
settings.},

as well as any attributes they may have. The widely used node-link diagrams excel
at this task, but many are difficult to extract meaning from because of the inherent
complexity of the relationships and limited screen space. To help address this problem
we introduce a technique called motif simplification, in which common patterns of
nodes and links are replaced with compact and meaningful glyphs. Well-designed glyphs
have several benefits: they (1) require less screen space and layout effort, (2) are
easier to understand in the context of the network, (3) can reveal otherwise hidden
relationships, and (4) preserve as much underlying information as possible. We tackle
three frequently occurring and high-payoff motifs: fans of nodes with a single neighbor,
connectors that link a set of anchor nodes, and cliques of completely connected nodes.
We contribute design guidelines for motif glyphs; example glyphs for the fan, connector,
and clique motifs; algorithms for detecting these motifs; a free and open source reference
implementation; and results from a controlled study of 36 participants that demonstrates
the effectiveness of motif simplification.},

observations about their prenatal behavior, and as accurately as 80-83% when additionally
leveraging the initial 2-3 weeks of postnatal data. The study is motivated by the
opportunity to use social media to identify mothers at risk of postpartum depression,

of design practice, reveals potentially hidden agendas and values, and explores alternative

We argue that its central concepts and methods are unclear and difficult to adopt.
Rather than merely attempting to decode the intentions of its originators, Dunne and
Raby, we instead turn to traditions of critical thought in the past 150 years to explore
a range of critical ideas and their practical uses. We then suggest ways that these
ideas and uses can be leveraged as practical resources for HCI researchers interested
in critical design. We also offer readings of two designs, which are not billed as
critical designs, but which we argue are critical using a broader formulation of the
concept than the one found in the current literature.},

identity as a particular item and more in the object's ability to provide access to
an intellectual work. The work, a familiar concept in information studies and textual
studies, designates a general product of intellectual creation that may be instantiated
in many versions. (For example, Shakespeare's Hamlet exists in many editions and forms,
which may differ in both content and carrier and yet still are all Hamlet.) The paper
demonstrates how the concept of the work can extend research on the perceived value

of every touch, a clipboard based on personal subareas dynamically placed on the surface,
and a handheld clipboard based on integration of personal devices for surface interaction.
In a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of personal clipboards for shared

method and a peer-based method, against a more conventional group-binding method based
on scanning and passwords. The results indicate that the participants strongly preferred
the touch-based methods in both pragmatic and hedonic qualities as well as in the
overall attractiveness. While the leader-driven method allowed better control over
the group and required only one participant to be able to form a group, the peer-based
method helped to create a greater sense of community and scaled better for larger
group sizes and distances. As the optimal group-binding method depends on the social
situation and physical environment, the binding methods should be flexible, allowing
the users to adapt them to different contexts of use. For determining the order of
the devices, manual arrangement was preferred over defining the order by touching.},

take a step further to look at body games: games in which the main source of enjoyment
comes from bodily engagement. We argue that for these games, the physical and social
settings become just as important design resources as the technology. Although all
body games benefit from an integrated design approach, the social and physical setting
become particularly useful as design resources when the technology has limited sensing
capabilities. We develop our understanding of body games through a literature study
and a concrete design experiment with designing multiplayer games for the BodyBug,
a mobile device with limited sensing capabilities. Although the device was designed
for free and natural movements, previous games fell short in realizing this design
ideal. By designing the technology function together with its physical and social
context, we were able to overcome device limitations. One of the games was subsequently
incorporated in its commercial release.},

abstract = {In this paper we report on an exploration of how to apply the theory of Slow Design
to mass produced products to establish more mindful usage of products; the intention
behind this is to promote product attachment and the associated sustainable benefits
of long term use. Slow Design is a design philosophy that focuses on promoting well-being
for individuals, society, and the natural environment. It encourages people to do
things at the right time and at the right speed which helps them to understand and
reflect on their actions. Several authors have proposed Slow Design principles and
cases have been reported in which these principles were applied in cultural design
projects. These applications indicated that Slow Design can indeed have a positive
impact on wellbeing. Although promising, this philosophy has not yet been used in
the design of mass consumer products. In this paper we present a design case study
in which we explored how the Slow Design principles can be applied in the design of
an electric fruit juicer. Two studies are reported on where the conditions for implementing
Slow Design are explored. The results led to a revision of the principles for use
by product designers. The main finding from the case study is that the Slow Design
principles can be used to create more 'mindful' interactions that stimulate positive
user involvement. This is not from designing interactions that require more time per
se, but by stimulating the user to use more time for those parts of the interaction
that are meaningful and less for those that are not meaningful.},

Weather Stations', reveal the home's microclimate by highlighting small gusts of wind,
the colour of ambient light, and temperature differentials within the home. We found
that participants initially tended to relate to the devices in line with two 'orienting
narratives' of environmental tools or ludic designs, finding the devices disappointing
from either perspective. Most of our participants showed lingering affection for the
devices, however, for a variety of reasons. We discuss the implications of this 'sporadic

in which the police actively decreased the distance to the citizens. In workshops

the identified practices. Our study discusses benefits and risks of the two approaches

based on Twitter posts that were automatically inferred to be hyperlocal. Whoo.ly
automatically extracts and summarizes hyperlocal information about events, topics,
people, and places from these Twitter posts. We provide an overview of our design
goals with Whoo.ly and describe the system including the user interface and our unique
event detection and summarization algorithms. We tested the usefulness of the system
as a tool for finding neighborhood information through a comprehensive user study.
The outcome demonstrated that most participants found Whoo.ly easier to use than Twitter
and they would prefer it as a tool for exploring their neighborhoods.},
