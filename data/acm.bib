abstract = { Speech recognition is unreliable in noisy places, compromises privacy and security
when around strangers, and inaccessible to people with speech disorders. Lip reading
can mitigate many of these challenges but the existing silent speech recognizers for
lip reading are error prone. Developing new recognizers and acquiring new datasets
is impractical for many since it requires enormous amount of time, effort, and other
resources. To address these, first, we develop LipType, an optimized version of LipNet
for improved speed and accuracy. We then develop an independent repair model that
processes video input for poor lighting conditions, when applicable, and corrects
potential errors in output for increased accuracy. We then test this model with LipType
and other speech and silent speech recognizers to demonstrate its effectiveness. },

the Auth+Track model, we present PanoTrack, a prototype that integrates body and near
field hand information for user tracking. We install a fisheye camera on the top of
the phone to achieve a panoramic vision that can capture both user’s body and on-screen
hands. Based on the captured video stream, we develop an algorithm to extract 1) features
for user tracking, including body keypoints and their temporal and spatial association,
near field hand status, and 2) features for user identity assignment. The results
of our user studies validate the feasibility of PanoTrack and demonstrate that Auth+Track
not only improves the authentication efficiency but also enhances user experiences
with better usability.},

conventional input modalities such as touchscreens are not available. Existing works
have focused on gesture recognition using image sensors. However, their cost, high

miniaturized 60 GHz radar sensor. The technique recognizes four directional swipes
and an omni-swipe using a radar chip (6.5 \texttimes{} 5.0 mm) integrated into a mobile phone.
We developed a convolutional neural network model efficient enough for battery powered
and computationally constrained processors. Its model size and inference time is less
than 1/5000 compared to an existing gesture recognition technique using radar. Our
evaluations with large scale datasets consisting of 558,000 gesture samples and 3,920,000
negative samples demonstrated our algorithm’s efficiency, robustness, and readiness
to be deployed outside of research laboratories. },

abstract = {We propose a novel modality for active biometric authentication: electrical muscle
stimulation (EMS). To explore this, we engineered an interactive system, which we
call ElectricAuth, that stimulates the user’s forearm muscles with a sequence of electrical
impulses (i.e., EMS challenge) and measures the user’s involuntary finger movements
(i.e., response to the challenge). ElectricAuth leverages EMS’s intersubject variability,
where the same electrical stimulation results in different movements in different
users because everybody’s physiology is unique (e.g., differences in bone and muscular
structure, skin resistance and composition, etc.). As such, ElectricAuth allows users
to login without memorizing passwords or PINs. ElectricAuth’s challenge-response structure
makes it secure against data breaches and replay attacks, a major vulnerability facing
today’s biometrics such as facial recognition and fingerprints. Furthermore, ElectricAuth
never reuses the same challenge twice in authentications – in just one second of stimulation
it encodes one of 68M possible challenges. In our user studies, we found that ElectricAuth
resists: (1) impersonation attacks (false acceptance rate: 0.17% at 5% false rejection
rate); (2) replay attacks (false acceptance rate: 0.00% at 5% false rejection rate);
and, (3) synthesis attacks (false acceptance rates: 0.2-2.5%). Our longitudinal study
also shows that ElectricAuth produces consistent results over time and across different
humidity and muscle conditions. },

form a loop. We implemented a prototype controller in which AtaTouch detects the finger
pinch of the grabbing hand. A user test with the prototype showed a finger-touch detection
accuracy of 96.4%. Another user test with the scenarios of moving virtual blocks demonstrated

In this paper, we show how super-resolution techniques, long used in fields such as
biology and astronomy, can be applied to capacitive touchscreen data. By integrating
data from many frames, our software-only process is able to resolve geometric details
finer than the original sensor resolution. This opens the door to passive tangibles

data analyst event logs in order to design better tools, identify failure points,
and guide users. However, this remains challenging because individual- and session-level
behavioral differences lead to an explosion of complexity and there are few guarantees
that log observations map to user cognition. In this paper we introduce a technique
for segmenting sequential analyst event logs which combines data, interaction, and
user features in order to create discrete blocks of goal-directed activity. Using
measures of inter-dependency and comparisons between analysis states, these blocks
identify patterns in interaction logs coupled with the current view that users are
examining. Through an analysis of publicly available data and data from a lab study
across a variety of analysis tasks, we validate that our segmentation approach aligns
with users’ changing goals and tasks. Finally, we identify several downstream applications
for our approach. },

We investigate the effects of showing grade predictions to students through an interactive
visualization tool. A qualitative study suggests that in the presence of predictions,
students may focus too much on maximizing their performance, to the detriment of other
factors such as the workload. A follow-up quantitative study explored whether these
effects are mitigated by changing how predictions are conveyed. Our observations suggest
the presence of a framing effect that induces students to put more effort into course
selection when faced with more specific predictions. We discuss these and other findings
and outline considerations for designing better data-driven course selection tools.

integrates a set of algorithms to steer the process, and rich interactions and visualization
designs to help interpret the differences between models in both model and instance

usability problems during pilot studies and make individual analysis processes salient.
To demonstrate the applicability of reVISit to visualization studies, we analyze participant

used to reveal and describe novel interaction patterns, to analyze performance differences
between different analysis strategies, and to validate or challenge design decisions.

about learning curves for the domain experts who have limited knowledge about programming.
In this paper, we propose IGScript, a novel script-based interaction grammar tool,
to help build scientific data presentation animations for communication. We design
a dual-space interface and a compiler which converts natural language-like grammar
statements or scripts into a data story animation to make an interactive customization
on script-driven data presentations, and then develop a code generator (decompiler)
to translate the interactive data exploration animations back into script codes to
achieve statement parameters. IGScript makes the presentation animations editable,
e.g., it allows to cut, copy, paste, append, or even delete some animation clips.
We demonstrate the usability, customizability, and flexibility of IGScript by a user
study, four case studies conducted by using four types of commonly-used scientific

abstract = { AI models are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains like health and conservation.
Data quality carries an elevated significance in high-stakes AI due to its heightened
downstream impact, impacting predictions like cancer detection, wildlife poaching,
and loan allocations. Paradoxically, data is the most under-valued and de-glamorised
aspect of AI. In this paper, we report on data practices in high-stakes AI, from interviews
with 53 AI practitioners in India, East and West African countries, and USA. We define,
identify, and present empirical evidence on Data Cascades—compounding events causing
negative, downstream effects from data issues—triggered by conventional AI/ML practices
that undervalue data quality. Data cascades are pervasive (92% prevalence), invisible,
delayed, but often avoidable. We discuss HCI opportunities in designing and incentivizing
data excellence as a first-class citizen of AI, resulting in safer and more robust
systems for all.},

the harsh outdoor environment in which HWDs will be used, the extensive workload of

separates those who introduce new functionality to the smart home (pilot users) from
those who do not (passenger users). To investigate the prevalence and impact of pilot-passenger
user relationships, we conducted a Mechanical Turk survey and a series of one-hour
interviews. Our results suggest that pilot-passenger relationships are common in multi-user
households and shape how people form habits around devices. We find from interview
data that smart homes reflect the values of their pilot users, making it harder for
passenger users to incorporate their devices into daily life. We conclude the paper
with design recommendations to improve passenger and pilot user experience.},

In the first two experiments we identify possible factors, and in the third we ask

length, jargon use, sentence structure, and vocabulary. This provides novel empirical
support for previously untested long-standing guidelines on message design, and informs

abstract = { Program tracing, or mentally simulating a program on concrete inputs, is an important
part of general program comprehension. Programs involve many kinds of virtual state
that must be held in memory, such as variable/value pairs and a call stack. In this
work, we examine the influence of short-term working memory (WM) on a person’s ability
to remember program state during tracing. We first confirm that previous findings
in cognitive psychology transfer to the programming domain: people can keep about
7 variable/value pairs in WM, and people will accidentally swap associations between
variables due to WM load. We use a restricted focus viewing interface to further analyze
the strategies people use to trace through programs, and the relationship of tracing
strategy to WM. Given a straight-line program, we find half of our participants traced
a program from the top-down line-by-line (linearly), and the other half start at the
bottom and trace upward based on data dependencies (on-demand). Participants with
an on-demand strategy made more WM errors while tracing straight-line code than with
a linear strategy, but the two strategies contained an equal number of WM errors when
tracing code with functions. We conclude with the implications of these findings for
the design of programming tools: first, programs should be analyzed to identify and
refactor human-memory-intensive sections of code. Second, programming environments
should interactively visualize variable metadata to reduce WM load in accordance with
a person’s tracing strategy. Third, tools for program comprehension should enable
externalizing program state while tracing.},

how our revision assistant can best support students, we have implemented four versions

of the system, then analyze the efficacy of the different versions through a Wizard
of Oz study with university students. Our results show that while a simple interface
with no revision feedback is easier to use, an interface that provides a detailed

on the development of a purpose-first programming prototype that teaches five patterns

abstract = {The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) bring human-AI
interaction to the forefront of HCI research. This paper argues that games are an
ideal domain for studying and experimenting with how humans interact with AI. Through
a systematic survey of neural network games (n = 38), we identified the dominant interaction
metaphors and AI interaction patterns in these games. In addition, we applied existing
human-AI interaction guidelines to further shed light on player-AI interaction in
the context of AI-infused systems. Our core finding is that AI as play can expand
current notions of human-AI interaction, which are predominantly productivity-based.
In particular, our work suggests that game and UX designers should consider flow to
structure the learning curve of human-AI interaction, incorporate discovery-based
learning to play around with the AI and observe the consequences, and offer users
an invitation to play to explore new forms of human-AI interaction. },

objective performance information of the machine learning model underlying a decision
aid is absent or scarce, how do people decide their reliance on the model? Through
three randomized experiments, we explore the heuristics people may use to adjust their
reliance on machine learning models when performance feedback is limited. We find
that the level of agreement between people and a model on decision-making tasks that
people have high confidence in significantly affects reliance on the model if people
receive no information about the model’s performance, but this impact will change
after aggregate-level model performance information becomes available. Furthermore,
the influence of high confidence human-model agreement on people’s reliance on a model
is moderated by people’s confidence in cases where they disagree with the model. We
discuss potential risks of these heuristics, and provide design implications on promoting
appropriate reliance on AI.},

for data scientists and domain experts (e.g., data exploration, model training, etc.).
Only till recently, machine learning(ML) researchers have developed promising automation
techniques to aid data workers in these tasks. This paper introduces AutoDS, an automated
machine learning (AutoML) system that aims to leverage the latest ML automation techniques
to support data science projects. Data workers only need to upload their dataset,
then the system can automatically suggest ML configurations, preprocess data, select
algorithm, and train the model. These suggestions are presented to the user via a
web-based graphical user interface and a notebook-based programming user interface.
Our goal is to offer a systematic investigation of user interaction and perceptions
of using an AutoDS system in solving a data science task. We studied AutoDS with 30
professional data scientists, where one group used AutoDS, and the other did not,
to complete a data science project. As expected, AutoDS improves productivity; Yet
surprisingly, we find that the models produced by the AutoDS group have higher quality
and less errors, but lower human confidence scores. We reflect on the findings by
presenting design implications for incorporating automation techniques into human
work in the data science lifecycle.},

abstract = { For machine learning models to be most useful in numerous sociotechnical systems,
many have argued that they must be human-interpretable. However, despite increasing
interest in interpretability, there remains no firm consensus on how to measure it.
This is especially true in representation learning, where interpretability research
has focused on “disentanglement” measures only applicable to synthetic datasets and
not grounded in human factors. We introduce a task to quantify the human-interpretability
of generative model representations, where users interactively modify representations
to reconstruct target instances. On synthetic datasets, we find performance on this
task much more reliably differentiates entangled and disentangled models than baseline
approaches. On a real dataset, we find it differentiates between representation learning
methods widely believed but never shown to produce more or less interpretable models.
In both cases, we ran small-scale think-aloud studies and large-scale experiments
on Amazon Mechanical Turk to confirm that our qualitative and quantitative results
agreed.},

performance, where team accuracy is higher than either the human or the AI working
solo? We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy
comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions).
While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased
by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept
the AI’s recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges
for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate
trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?},

We take a developmental step towards socially-situated XAI by introducing and exploring
Social Transparency (ST), a sociotechnically informed perspective that incorporates
the socio-organizational context into explaining AI-mediated decision-making. To explore
ST conceptually, we conducted interviews with 29 AI users and practitioners grounded
in a speculative design scenario. We suggested constitutive design elements of ST
and developed a conceptual framework to unpack ST’s effect and implications at the
technical, decision-making, and organizational level. The framework showcases how
ST can potentially calibrate trust in AI, improve decision-making, facilitate organizational
collective actions, and cultivate holistic explainability. Our work contributes to
the discourse of Human-Centered XAI by expanding the design space of XAI.},

resilience, agency and control. Dissonances between what our participants valued and
the perceived values of technology have led them to become critical adopters of technology,
and resist its intrusion into certain aspects of their lives. We discuss how the critical
perspectives of older adults and the value dissonances they experience are valuable

Therefore, we first conducted an empirical pre-study with 24 consumers to understand

finally evaluated it in a real-world trial with ten consumers. Our findings show how
recommender systems can support the negotiation of ethical values within the context
of consumption practices, reduce the complexity of finding products and stores, and
strengthen consumers. In addition to providing implications for the design to support

the inclusion of individuals who would ordinarily be unlikely to seek cybersecurity
information and thus may be vulnerable to cyberattacks. We report on ways the CyberGuardians

citizens for the citizens, (2) the use of open and accessible technology, and (3)
the initiatives’ public narrative, giving them a voice on the environmental issue.

abstract = { Dance provides unique opportunities for embodied interdisciplinary learning experiences
that can be personally and culturally relevant. danceON is a system that supports
learners to leverage their body movement as they engage in artistic practices across
data science, computing, and dance. The technology includes a Domain Specific Language
(DSL) with declarative syntax and reactive behavior, a media player with pose detection
and classification, and a web-based IDE. danceON provides a low-floor allowing users
to bind virtual shapes to body positions in under three lines of code, while also
enabling complex, dynamic animations that users can design working with conditionals
and past position data. We developed danceON to support distance learning and deployed
it in two consecutive cohorts of a remote, two-week summer camp for young women of
color. We present our findings from an analysis of the experience and the resulting
computational performances. The work identifies implications for how design can support
learners’ expression across culturally relevant themes and examines challenges from
the lens of usability of the computing language and technology.},

abstract = { Directly manipulating the timeline, such as scrubbing for thumbnails, is the standard
way of controlling how-to videos. However, when how-to videos involve physical activities,
people inconveniently alternate between controlling the video and performing the tasks.
Adopting a voice user interface allows people to control the video with voice while
performing the tasks with hands. However, naively translating timeline manipulation
into voice user interfaces (VUI) results in temporal referencing (e.g. “rewind 20
seconds”), which requires a different mental model for navigation and thereby limiting
users’ ability to peek into the content. We present RubySlippers, a system that supports
efficient content-based voice navigation through keyword-based queries. Our computational
pipeline automatically detects referenceable elements in the video, and finds the
video segmentation that minimizes the number of needed navigational commands. Our
evaluation (N=12) shows that participants could perform three representative navigation
tasks with fewer commands and less frustration using RubySlippers than the conventional
voice-enabled video interface.},

This back-end processing is used to provide an interactive visualization to support
effective video navigation and real-time feedback on the user's performance, creating
a guided learning experience. We demonstrate the capabilities and specific use-cases
of Soloist within the domain of learning electric guitar solos using instructional
YouTube videos. A remote user study, conducted to gather feedback from guitar players,
shows encouraging results as the users unanimously preferred learning with Soloist

Mindless Attractor, that leverages the nature of human speech communication to help
learners refocus their attention without relying on their motivation. Specifically,
it perturbs the voice in the video to direct their attention without consuming their
conscious awareness. Our experiments not only confirmed the validity of the proposed
approach but also emphasized its advantages in combination with a machine learning-based
sensing module. Namely, it would not frustrate users even though the intervention
is activated by false-positive detection of their attentive state. Our intervention
approach can be a reliable way to induce behavioral change in human–AI symbiosis.},

show that the driver may not react to it. We present DeepTake, a novel deep neural
network-based framework that predicts multiple aspects of takeover behavior to ensure
that the driver is able to safely take over the control when engaged in non-driving
tasks. Using features from vehicle data, driver biometrics, and subjective measurements,
DeepTake predicts the driver’s intention, time, and quality of takeover. We evaluate
DeepTake performance using multiple evaluation metrics. Results show that DeepTake
reliably predicts the takeover intention, time, and quality, with an accuracy of 96%,
93%, and 83%, respectively. Results also indicate that DeepTake outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods on predicting driver takeover time and quality. Our findings

from instructional makeup videos. Our approach is inspired by prior research in cognitive
psychology, which suggests that people mentally segment procedural tasks into event
hierarchies, where coarse-grained events focus on objects while fine-grained events
focus on actions. In the instructional makeup domain, we find that objects correspond
to facial parts while fine-grained steps correspond to actions on those facial parts.
Given an input instructional makeup video, we apply a set of heuristics that combine
computer vision techniques with transcript text analysis to automatically identify
the fine-level action steps and group these steps by facial part to form the coarse-level
events. We provide a voice-enabled, mixed-media UI to visualize the resulting hierarchy
and allow users to efficiently navigate the tutorial (e.g., skip ahead, return to
previous steps) at their own pace. Users can navigate the hierarchy at both the facial-part
and action-step levels using click-based interactions and voice commands. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of segmentation algorithms and the resulting mixed-media UI on a
variety of input makeup videos. A user study shows that users prefer following instructional
makeup videos in our mixed-media format to the standard video UI and that they find
our format much easier to navigate. },

expressive visual inputs becomes challenging with many viewers, primarily due to the
relative lack of structure in visual input. On the other hand, adding rigid structures
can limit viewer interactions to narrow use cases or decrease the expressiveness of
viewer inputs. To facilitate the sensemaking of many visual inputs while retaining
the expressiveness or versatility of viewer interactions, we introduce a visual input
management framework (VIMF) and a system, VisPoll, that help streamers specify, aggregate,
and visualize many visual inputs. A pilot evaluation indicated that VisPoll can expand
the types of viewer interactions. Our framework provides insights for designing scalable

testbed games exploring asymmetric interdependent roles. In a remote study with 13
mixed-visual-ability pairs we assessed how roles affected perceptions of engagement,
competence, and autonomy, using a mixed-methods approach. The games provided an engaging
and challenging experience, in which differences in visual ability were not limiting.
Our results underline how experiences unequal by design can give rise to an equitable
joint experience.},

abstract = { Videogames’ increasing cultural relevance and suffusion into everyday use contexts
suggests they can no longer be considered novelties. Broadly speaking, games research
at CHI has concerned two forms of peak experience—historically, research aimed to
support flow, or maximise enjoyment and positive emotions; more recently, scholarship
engages with more varied experiences of intense emotion, such as emotional challenge.
In different ways, both approaches emphasise extra-ordinary player experience (PX).
Conversely, videogame play and PX have become more routine—indeed, more ordinary—as
the medium’s cultural presence grows. In this paper, we argue that HCI games research
is conceptually ill-equipped to investigate these increasingly common and often desirable
experiences. We conceptualise “ordinary player experience” – as familiar, emotionally
moderate, co-attentive, and abstractly memorable – articulating a phenomenon whose
apparent mundanity has seen it elude description to date. We discuss opportunities
to productively employ ordinary PX in HCI games research, alongside conceptual implications
for PX and player wellbeing.},

To begin our exploration in this domain, we investigated what the return experience

in the past, we revealed a phenomenon we call The Pivot Point, a ‘eureka’ moment in
return gameplay. The pivot point anchors our design explorations, where we created
prototypes to leverage the pivot point in reconnecting with the experience. These
return experiences and subsequent prototyping iterations inform our understanding
of how to design better returns to gameplay, which can benefit both producers and
consumers of long-term single player games.},

collection from NPC dialogues and traditional in-game overlay questionnaires. Data
quality and player experience measures autonomy, curiosity, immersion, and mastery
did not differ significantly, although NPC dialogues enhanced meaning. NPC dialogues
supported an increase in data quantity through voluntary 5-point scales but not via
open responses; however, they also increased the perceived intimacy of shared information
despite comparable objective intimacy. NPC dialogues are useful to gather quantitative
self-report data. They enable a meaningful play experience but could facilitate negative

effort was low (boredom), moderate when reward and effort were balanced (flow), and
highest when the reward was low and effort was high (frustration). Surprisingly, player
response times to a secondary task showed the greatest improvement when playing the
frustrating video game condition. We interpret this latter finding as evidence of
an observed task-switching effect: players initially tried to master the game's over-challenging
primary task before giving up and, instead, diverted attention toward a secondary
in-game task that required less effort and thus, gave greater attentional rewards
to the player. The implications of this cognitive offloading are discussed.},

players were rarely involved before and during the production to evaluate the emotional

nor it can be removed to support free movements. This paper introduces GamesBond,
a pair of 4-DoF controllers without physical linkage but capable to create the illusion
of being connected as a single device, forming a virtual bond. The two controllers
work together by dynamically displaying and physically rendering deformations of hand
grips, and so allowing users to perceive a single connected object between the hands,
such as a jumping rope. With a user study and various applications we show that GamesBond
increases the realism, immersion, and enjoyment of bimanual interaction.},

Hands in two studies. The first study shows that compared to a single hand, 4 and
8 hands are significantly faster for selecting targets. The second study complements
this finding by using a larger target layout with many distractors. We find no decrease
in selection time across 8, 27, and 64 hands, but an increase in the time spent deciding
which hand to use. Thereby, net movement time still decreases significantly. In both
studies, the physical motion exerted also decreases significantly with more hands.

various stiffness and roughness, respectively. By further independently controlling
the hairs’ configuration and pins’ height, versatile stiffness, roughness and surface
height differences are achieved. We conducted a perception study to realize users’
distinguishability of stiffness and roughness on each of the segments. Based on the
results, we performed a VR experience study to verify that the tactile feedback from
HairTouch enhances VR realism.},

abstract = {For haptic guidance, vibrotactile feedback is a commonly-used mechanism, but requires
users to interpret its complicated patterns especially in 3D guidance, which is not
intuitive and increases their mental effort. Furthermore, for haptic guidance in virtual
reality (VR), not only guidance performance but also realism should be considered.
Since vibrotactile feedback interferes with and reduces VR realism, it may not be
proper for VR haptic guidance. Therefore, we propose a wearable device, GuideBand,
to provide intuitive 3D multilevel force guidance upon the forearm, which reproduces
an effect that the forearm is pulled and guided by a virtual guider or telepresent
person in VR. GuideBand uses three motors to pull a wristband at different force levels
in 3D space. Such feedback usually requires much larger and heavier robotic arms or
exoskeletons. We conducted a just-noticeable difference study to understand users’
force level distinguishability. Based on the results, we performed a study to verify
that compared with state-of-the-art vibrotactile guidance, GuideBand is more intuitive,
needs a lower level of mental effort, and achieves similar guidance performance. We
further conducted a VR experience study to observe how users combine and complement
visual and force guidance, and prove that GuideBand enhances realism in VR guidance.

that other factors, such as full-time freelancer status and level of self-esteem,
may help explain gender differences in bill rates. To better support equity and fairness

that are voiced by humans, are emerging as live streamers and attracting a growing
viewership in East Asia. Although prior research has found that many viewers seek
real-life interpersonal interactions with real-person streamers, it is currently unknown
what makes VTuber live streams engaging or how they are perceived differently than
real-person streamers. We conducted an interview study to understand how viewers engage
with VTubers and perceive the identities of the voice actors behind the avatars (i.e.,
Nakanohito). The data revealed that Virtual avatars bring unique performative opportunities
which result in different viewer expectations and interpretations of VTuber behavior.
Viewers intentionally upheld the disembodiment of VTuber avatars from their voice
actors. We uncover the nuances in viewer perceptions and attitudes and further discuss
the implications of VTuber practices to the understanding of live streaming in general.

would instead cause early interactions to cascade into different judgments for similar
cases. In this paper, we report an online experiment that changes participants’ pseudonyms
as they appear to collaborators, temporarily masking a jury’s awareness that they
have deliberated together before. This technique allows us to measure consistency
by reconvening the same jury on similar cases. Counter to expectation, juries are
equally consistent as individuals, a result that is “good for democracy.” But this
consistency arises in part due to group polarization, as consensus develops by hardening
initial majority opinions. Furthermore, we find that aggregating groups’ perspectives
without deliberation erodes consistency.},

73% of CHI study findings are based on Western participant samples, representing less
than 12% of the world’s population. Furthermore, we show that most participant samples
at CHI tend to come from industrialized, rich, and democratic countries with generally
highly educated populations. Encouragingly, recent years have seen a slight increase
in non-Western samples and those that include several countries. We discuss suggestions
for further broadening the international representation of CHI participant samples.},

pilots to arbitrarily position and rotate a drone using position-control direct interactions
on a see-through mobile AR where the drone position and direction are visualized with
a virtual cast shadow (i.e., the drone’s orthogonal projection onto the floor). Pilots
can point to the next position or draw the drone’s flight trajectory by manipulating
the virtual cast shadow and the direction/height slider bar on the touchscreen. We
design and implement a prototype of PinpointFly for indoor and visual line of sight
scenarios, which are comprised of real-time and predefined motion-control techniques.
We conduct two user studies with simple positioning and inspection tasks. Our results
demonstrate that PinpointFly makes the drone positioning and inspection operations
faster, more accurate, simpler and fewer workload than a conventional joystick interface
with a speed-control method.},

interview study (N=25) to specify user needs for explanations from users of existing
OSCs. Then, we designed a COVID-19 OSC that was enhanced with three types of explanations.
Our lab-controlled user study (N=20) found that explanations can significantly improve
user experience in multiple aspects. We discuss how explanations are interwoven into
conversation flow and present implications for future OSC designs.},

in managerial and organizational contexts, ranging from employment to dismissal. However,
to avoid employees’ antipathy toward AI, it is important to understand what aspects

perceive current human resource (HR) teams and future algorithmic management. Specifically,
we explored what factors negatively influence employees’ perceptions of AI making
work performance evaluations. Through in-depth interviews with 21 workers, we found
that 1) employees feel six types of burdens (i.e., emotional, mental, bias, manipulation,
privacy, and social) toward AI's introduction to human resource management (HRM),
and that 2) these burdens could be mitigated by incorporating transparency, interpretability,
and human intervention to algorithmic decision-making. Based on our findings, we present
design efforts to alleviate employees’ burdens. To leverage AI for HRM in fair and
trustworthy ways, we call for the HCI community to design human-AI collaboration systems
with various HR stakeholders.},

In this paper, we present the findings from a qualitative study (N=11) of public attitude

are aware of the benefits of shared mobility for the environment and society, and
are generally open to using it. However, 1) emotional factors mitigate this openness
and 2) security concerns were expressed by female participants. We recommend that
identified concerns must be addressed to allow AVs fully exploiting their benefits

an additional yielding intent message. We conducted a video-based laboratory study
(N = 67) to investigate pedestrians’ trust and crossing behavior in repeated encounters
with AVs. In a 2x2 between-subjects design, we investigated (1) the occurrence of
a malfunction (AV failing to yield) and (2) system transparency (status eHMI vs. status+intent
eHMI). Results show that during initial encounters, trust gradually increases and
crossing onset time decreases. After a malfunction, trust declines but recovers quickly.
In the status eHMI group, trust was reduced more, and participants showed 7.3 times
higher odds of colliding with the AV as compared to the status+intent group. We conclude
that a status eHMI can cause pedestrians to overtrust AVs and advocate additional
intent messages.},

road safety statistics and traffic psychology at least define VRUs as pedestrians,

group already poses a broad spectrum of research challenges, a one-fits-all solution
seems unrealistic and inappropriate, and a much clearer differentiation is required.
To foster clarity and comprehensibility, we propose a literature-based taxonomy providing
a structured separation of (vulnerable) road users, designed to particularly (but
not exclusively) support research on the communication between VRUs and AVs. It consists
of two conceptual hierarchies and will help practitioners and researchers by providing
a uniform and comparable set of terms needed for the design, implementation, and description
of HCI applications.},

We also hypothesize that credibility ratings mediate this relationship. We asked N

were humans or social bots. Findings support our motivated reasoning hypothesis for
a sub-group of Twitter users (those who are more familiar with Twitter): Accounts
that are opinion-incongruent are evaluated as relatively more bot-like than accounts
that are opinion-congruent. Moreover, it does not matter whether the account is clearly
social bot or human or ambiguous about its nature. This was mediated by perceived
credibility in the sense that congruent profiles were evaluated to be more credible
resulting in lower perceptions as bots.},

By analyzing exemplar research-through-design cases and a literature survey on the
use of expressivity in interaction, we discuss how different perspectives and concepts
contribute to understand expressivity in interaction. We integrate these perspectives
and make them operational for interaction design by creating a framework including
design considerations such as freedom of interaction, action-perception loops, multimodality,
subtlety, ambiguity, skill development and temporal form. The framework is a result
of a mixed-method approach including a review of existing definitions and scholarly
artefacts, and a systematic literature review to identify design cases including an
analysis of these design cases. We finally illustrate how the framework has been used
to inform the design of a shape-changing soft-robotic interface. As a result, we contribute
an integrated framework on how to design for expressivity in interaction.},

four design research case studies involving ML. We derive three provocative concepts:
thingly uncertainty: ML-driven artefacts have uncertain, variable relations to their

abstract = {User engagement with data privacy and security through consent banners has become
a ubiquitous part of interacting with internet services. While previous work has addressed
consent banners from either interaction design, legal, and ethics-focused perspectives,
little research addresses the connections among multiple disciplinary approaches,
including tensions and opportunities that transcend disciplinary boundaries. In this
paper, we draw together perspectives and commentary from HCI, design, privacy and
data protection, and legal research communities, using the language and strategies
of “dark patterns” to perform an interaction criticism reading of three different
types of consent banners. Our analysis builds upon designer, interface, user, and
social context lenses to raise tensions and synergies that arise together in complex,
contingent, and conflicting ways in the act of designing consent banners. We conclude
with opportunities for transdisciplinary dialogue across legal, ethical, computer
science, and interactive systems scholarship to translate matters of ethical concern
into public policy. },

Enforcer—to help this office guide immigrant residents through successfully engaging
the city's code enforcement process. To inform the design process, we adapted our
framework of trust-as-distance. While the framework was instrumental for integrating
issues of trust throughout our design process, it also introduced tensions between
how and by whom trust was enacted and interpreted. By reflecting on these tensions,
we tease out the political and moral elements of designing with trust vital for HCI

abuse. The hyper-realistic imagery of these manipulated videos coupled with the expedited
delivery models of social media platforms gives deception, propaganda, and disinformation
an entirely new meaning. Hence, raising awareness about DeepFakes and how to accurately
flag them has become imperative. However, given differences in human cognition and
perception, this is not straightforward. In this paper, we perform an investigative
user study and also analyze existing AI detection algorithms from the literature to
demystify the unknowns that are at play behind the scenes when detecting DeepFakes.
Based on our findings, we design a customized training program to improve detection
and evaluate on a treatment group of low-literate population, which is most vulnerable
to DeepFakes. Our results suggest that, while DeepFakes are becoming imperceptible,
contextualized education and training can help raise awareness and improve detection.

is the sole payer for the account in the former, whereas profile holders split the
cost in the latter. We distinguish two types of ownership in each practice—Primary
and Dual. In Primary ownership, the account owner has the power to allow others to
use the account; in Dual ownership, Primary ownership appears in conjunction with
joint ownership, notably displaying asymmetric ownership perceptions among users.
Conflicts arise when the sharing agreements collapse. Therefore, we propose design
recommendations that bridge ownership differences based on sharing practices of DS
accounts.},

accountability and transparency of political processes. To that end, we use the Facebook
Ads Library to collect 2312 migration-related advertising campaigns in Italy over
one year. Our pro- and anti-immigration classifier (F1=0.85) reveals a partisan divide
among the major Italian political parties, with anti-immigration ads accounting for
nearly 15M impressions. Although composing 47.6% of all migration-related ads, anti-immigration
ones receive 65.2% of impressions. We estimate that about two thirds of all captured
campaigns use some kind of demographic targeting by location, gender, or age. We find
sharp divides by age and gender: for instance, anti-immigration ads from major parties
are 17% more likely to be seen by a male user than a female. Unlike pro-migration
parties, we find that anti-immigration ones reach a similar demographic to their own
voters. However their audience change with topic: an ad from anti-immigration parties
is 24% more likely to be seen by a male user when the ad speaks about migration, than
if it does not. Furthermore, the viewership of such campaigns tends to follow the
volume of mainstream news around immigration, supporting the theory that political
advertisers try to “ride the wave” of current news. We conclude with policy implications
for political communication: since the Facebook Ads Library does not allow to distinguish
between advertisers intentions and algorithmic targeting, we argue that more details
should be shared by platforms regarding the targeting configuration of socio-political
campaigns. },

these factors to three categories, work identity, agency and community. These categories
are consistent with concepts from the Job Characteristics Model (JCM). The contribution

Here we investigate downstream consequences of social corrections on users’ subsequent

thus improving their subsequent sharing. Alternatively, corrections might not improve
subsequent sharing - or even backfire - by making users feel defensive, or by shifting
their attention away from accuracy (e.g., towards various social factors). We identified
N=2,000 users who shared false political news on Twitter, and replied to their false
tweets with links to fact-checking websites. We find causal evidence that being corrected
decreases the quality, and increases the partisan slant and language toxicity, of
the users’ subsequent retweets (but has no significant effect on primary tweets).
This suggests that being publicly corrected by another user shifts one's attention
away from accuracy - presenting an important challenge for social correction approaches.},

We asked 30 participants to assign colours and emotional categories to 3D-printed

and high arousal levels. Less complex round shapes were associated with blue colours,
high brightness and positive valence levels. These findings contrast previously reported
crossmodal effects triggered by 2D shapes of similar angularity and complexity, suggesting
that designers cannot simply extrapolate potential perceptual and interpretive experiences

abstract = { Task-irrelevant distractors affect visuo-motor control for target acquisition and
studying such effects has already received much attention in human-computer interaction.
However, there has been little research into distractor effects on crossing-based
interaction. We thus conducted an empirical study on pen-based interfaces to investigate
six crossing tasks with distractor interference in comparison to two tasks without
it. The six distractor-related tasks differed in movement precision constraint (directional/amplitude),
target size, target distance, distractor location and target-distractor spacing. We
also developed and experimentally validated six quantitative models for the six tasks.
Our results show that crossing targets with distractors had longer average times and
similar accuracy than that without distractors. The effects of distractors varied
depending on distractor location, target-distractor spacing and movement precision
constraint. When spacing is smaller than 11.27 mm, crossing tasks with distractor
interference can be regarded as pointing tasks or a combination of pointing and crossing
tasks, which could be better fitted with our proposed models than Fitts’ law. According
to these results, we provide practical implications to crossing-based user interface
design.},

excessively focus on virtual content while neglecting their physical surroundings.
This leads to the concern that users could neglect hazardous situations when using
AR applications. However, studies have often confounded the role of the virtual content
with the role of the associated task in inducing attentional tunneling. In this paper,
we disentangle the impact of the associated task and of the virtual content on the
attentional tunneling effect by measuring reaction times to events in two user studies.
We found that presenting virtual content did not significantly increase user reaction
times to events, but adding a task to the content did. This work contributes towards
our understanding of the attentional tunneling effect on handheld AR devices, and
highlights the need to consider both task and context when evaluating AR application
usage.},

on electrical muscle stimulation (EMS), have the unique potential to accelerate users’
own reaction time (RT). However, this speedup has only been explored while the device
is attached to the user. In fact, very little is known regarding whether this faster
reaction time still occurs after the user removes the device from their bodies–this
is precisely what we investigated by means of a simple reaction time (RT) experiment,
in which participants were asked to tap as soon as they saw an LED flashing. Participants
experienced this in three EMS conditions: (1) fast-EMS, the electrical impulses were
synced with the LED; (2) agency-EMS, the electrical impulse was delivered 40ms faster
than the participant’s own RT, which prior work has shown to preserve one’s sense
of agency over this movement; and, (3) late-EMS: the impulse was delivered after the
participant’s own RT. Our results revealed that the participants’ RT was significantly
reduced by approximately 8ms (up to 20ms) only after training with the agency-EMS
condition. This finding suggests that the prioritizing agency during EMS training
is key to motor-adaptation, i.e., it enables a faster motor response even after the
user has removed the EMS device from their body.},

pace. They then completed a series of hierarchical drag-and-drop trials in which folders
automatically expanded when the cursor hovered for longer than a controlled timeout.
Results showed that preferences for timeout values correlated with user pace – slow-paced
users preferred long timeouts, and fast-paced users preferred short timeouts. Results
indicate potential benefits in moving away from fixed or customisable settings for
system pace. Instead, systems could improve preferences by automatically adapting
their pace to converge towards that of the user.},

In this paper, we create a back-of-device command and text input technique called
BackSwipe, which allows a user to hold a smartphone with one hand, and use the index
finger of the same hand to draw a word-gesture anywhere at the back of the smartphone
to enter commands and text. To support BackSwipe, we propose a back-of-device word-gesture
decoding algorithm which infers the keyboard location from back-of-device gestures,
and adjusts the keyboard size to suit the gesture scales; the inferred keyboard is
then fed back into the system for decoding. Our user study shows BackSwipe is feasible
and a promising input method, especially for command input in the one-hand holding
posture: users can enter commands at an average accuracy of 92% with a speed of 5.32
seconds/command. The text entry performance varies across users. The average speed
is 9.58 WPM with some users at 18.83 WPM; the average word error rate is 11.04% with
some users at 2.85%. Overall, BackSwipe complements the extant smartphone interaction
by leveraging the back of the device as a gestural input surface. },

PhraseFlow, a phrase-level input keyboard that is able to correct previous text based

input introduced extra cognitive load to the user that hindered their performance.
Through an iterative design-implement-research process, we optimized the design of
PhraseFlow that alleviated the cognitive load. An in-lab study shows that users could
adopt PhraseFlow quickly, resulting in 19% fewer error without losing speed. In real-life
settings, we conducted a six-day deployment study with 42 participants, showing that
78.6% of the users would like to have the phrase-level input feature in future keyboards.

that inaudible frequencies can act as a substitute for privacy-sensitive frequencies.
To take advantage of these inaudible frequencies, we designed a Raspberry Pi-based
device that captures inaudible acoustic frequencies with settings that can remove

participants “eavesdropped’’ on PrivacyMic’s filtered audio and found that none of

data ethics as an increasingly important field of study. MyData is a related emerging
vision that emphasizes individuals’ control of their personal data. In this paper,
we investigate people’s perceptions of various data management scenarios by measuring
the perceived ethicality and level of felt concern concerning the scenarios. We deployed
a set of 96 unique scenarios to an online crowdsourcing platform for assessment and
invited a representative sample of the participants to a second-stage questionnaire
about the MyData vision and its potential in the field of healthcare. Our results
provide a timely investigation into how topical data-related practices affect the

many challenges of designing applications that address people’s needs in their health,
everyday lives, and collaborations with clinicians. Research suggests strategies to
address such challenges, but has struggled to translate these strategies into design
practice. This study examines translation of insights from personal health informatics
research into resources to support designers. Informed by a review of relevant literature,
we present our development of a prototype set of design cards intended to support
designers in re-thinking potential assumptions about personal health informatics.
We examined our design cards in semi-structured interviews, first with 12 student
designers and then with 12 health-focused professional designers and researchers.
Our results and discussion reveal tensions and barriers designers encounter, the potential
for translational resources to inform the design of health-related technologies, and
a need to support designers in addressing challenges of knowledge, advocacy, and evidence
in designing for health. },

Behavioural Model (IBM) to explore parents’ perspectives toward breastfeeding along
with their lived experiences, and examine the role of technology in this setting.
Results of twelve semi-structured interviews and 175 online survey responses suggest
generally positive attitudes toward breastfeeding and good theoretical knowledge.
This is combined with a complex lived experience of breastfeeding where main challenges
are situated in practical, emotional, and environmental/societal aspects, which are
currently not sufficiently recognised by technology that seeks to support breastfeeding.
Building upon our findings, we present points for reflection for the design of technology
to support breastfeeding, focusing on the importance of drawing from the lived experience
of parents, and ensuring that technology not only casts breastfeeding as an individual
but also as a collective effort.},

of two parts: one battery-powered voice-coil worn on the user's fingernail and any
number of interactive soft patches that can be attached onto any surface (everyday
objects, user's body, appliances, etc.). When the user's finger wearing our voice-coil
contacts any of the interactive patches it detects its magnetic signature via magnetometer
and vibrates the patch, adding haptic feedback to otherwise input-only interactions.
To allow these passive patches to vibrate, we make them from silicone with regions
doped with polarized neodymium powder, resulting in soft and stretchable magnets.
This stretchable form-factor allows them to be wrapped to the user's body or everyday
objects of various shapes. We demonstrate how these add haptic output to many situations,
such as adding haptic buttons to the walls of one's home. In our technical evaluation,
we demonstrate that our interactive patches can be excited across a wide range of
frequencies (0-500 Hz) and can be tuned to resonate at specific frequencies based
on the patch's geometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MagnetIO's vibration intensity
is as powerful as a typical linear resonant actuator (LRA); yet, unlike these rigid
actuators, our passive patches operate as springs with multiple modes of vibration,
which enables a wider band around its resonant frequency than an equivalent LRA.},

implicit techniques, where the efficiency of automation can be leveraged. The techniques
were implemented and evaluated using a tabletop HRC simulation in VR. A 16-participant

implicit techniques enable efficient task completion and task parallelization, and

abstract = {We propose a technique that allows an unprecedented level of dexterity in electrical
muscle stimulation (EMS), i.e., it allows interactive EMS-based devices to flex the
user's fingers independently of each other. EMS is a promising technique for force
feedback because of its small form factor when compared to mechanical actuators. However,
the current EMS approach to flexing the user's fingers (i.e., attaching electrodes
to the base of the forearm, where finger muscles anchor) is limited by its inability
to flex a target finger's metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint independently of the other
fingers. In other words, current EMS devices cannot flex one finger alone, they always
induce unwanted actuation to adjacent fingers. To tackle the lack of dexterity, we
propose and validate a new electrode layout that places the electrodes on the back
of the hand, where they stimulate the interossei/lumbricals muscles in the palm, which
have never received attention with regards to EMS. In our user study, we found that
our technique offers four key benefits when compared to existing EMS electrode layouts:
our technique (1) flexes all four fingers around the MCP joint more independently;
(2) has less unwanted flexion of other joints (such as the proximal interphalangeal
joint); (3) is more robust to wrist rotations; and (4) reduces calibration time. Therefore,
our EMS technique enables applications for interactive EMS systems that require a
level of flexion dexterity not available until now. We demonstrate the improved dexterity
with four example applications: three musical instrumental tutorials (piano, drum,
and guitar) and a VR application that renders force feedback in individual fingers
while manipulating a yo-yo.},

novel contact-rendering algorithms to enable a user to tactilely explore immersive
virtual environments. We evaluate rudimentary 1-DOF, moderate 3-DOF, and complex 6-DOF
tactile feedback during shape discrimination and mass discrimination, also comparing
to interactions with real objects. Results from 20 naive study participants show that
higher-dimensional tactile feedback may indeed allow completion of a wider range of

they clearly feel different when pressure is applied to them. Yet, to date, studies
only investigated force input on rigid surfaces. We present a first systematic evaluation
of the effects of compliance on force input. Results of a visual targeting task for
three levels of softness indicate that high force levels appear more demanding for
soft surfaces, but that performance is otherwise similar. Performance remained very
high (∼ 5% for 20 force levels) regardless of the compliance, suggesting force input
was underestimated so far. We infer implications for the design of force input on
soft surfaces and conclude that interaction models used on rigid surfaces might be
used on soft surfaces. },

Specifically, students use technologies to acquire social contact, find help and support,

abstract = { We propose TiltChair, an actuated office chair that physically manipulates the user’s
posture by actively inclining the chair’s seat to address problems associated with
prolonged sitting. The system controls the inclination angle and motion speed with
the aim of achieving manipulative but unobtrusive posture guidance. To demonstrate
its potential, we first built a prototype of TiltChair with a seat that could be tilted
by pneumatic control. We then investigated the effects of the seat’s inclination angle
and motions on task performance and overall sitting experience through two experiments.
The results show that the inclination angle mainly affects the difficulty of maintaining
one’s posture, while the motion speed affected the conspicuousness and subjective
acceptability of the motion. However, these seating conditions did not affect objective
task performance. Based on these results, we propose a design space for facilitating
effective seat-inclination behavior using the three dimensions of angle, speed, and
continuity. Furthermore, we discuss promising applications.},

analyses on goal achievements. Our results reveal that successful goal achievements
are largely dependent on the configuration of financial and social commitment devices,
and a mixed commitment setting is considered beneficial. We discuss how our findings
could inform the design of effective commitment devices, and how large-scale data
can be leveraged to support data-driven goal elicitation and customization.},

factors commonly thought to make machine learning models more or less interpretable:
the number of features and the transparency of the model (i.e., whether the model
internals are clear or black box). Predictably, participants who saw a clear model
with few features could better simulate the model’s predictions. However, we did not
find that participants more closely followed its predictions. Furthermore, showing
participants a clear model meant that they were less able to detect and correct for
the model’s sizable mistakes, seemingly due to information overload. These counterintuitive
findings emphasize the importance of testing over intuition when developing interpretable
models.},

behavior using eye tracking, the recognition accuracy for different video lengths,
and the assessment of emotions. Our experiments show that responses differ distinctly
