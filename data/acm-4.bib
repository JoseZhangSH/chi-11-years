abstract = {Current touch input technologies are best suited for small and flat applications,
such as smartphones, tablets and kiosks. In general, they are too expensive to scale
to large surfaces, such as walls and furniture, and cannot provide input on objects
having irregular and complex geometries, such as tools and toys. We introduce Electrick,
a low-cost and versatile sensing technique that enables touch input on a wide variety
of objects and surfaces, whether small or large, flat or irregular. This is achieved
by using electric field tomography in concert with an electrically conductive material,
which can be easily and cheaply added to objects and surfaces. We show that our technique
is compatible with commonplace manufacturing methods, such as spray/brush coating,
vacuum forming, and casting/molding enabling a wide range of possible uses and outputs.
Our technique can also bring touch interactivity to rapidly fabricated objects, including
those that are laser cut or 3D printed. Through a series of studies and illustrative
example uses, we show that Electrick can enable new interactive opportunities on a
diverse set of objects and surfaces that were previously static.},

if multiple touches are caused by different fingers on a single hand, by fingers from
both hands of a single user, or by different users. This limitation significantly
reduces the possibilities for interaction techniques in touch interfaces. We present

in a frequency-division touch controller, to differentiate touches from the same hand
or different hands of a single user (77% reliability at 60 fps) or from two different
users (95% reliability at 60 fps). In addition to GhostID, we also develop a framework
of user-differentiation capabilities for touch input devices, and illustrate a set
of interaction techniques enabled by GhostID.},

abstract = {We present Group Touch, a method for distinguishing among multiple users simultaneously
interacting with a tabletop computer using only the touch information supplied by
the device. Rather than tracking individual users for the duration of an activity,
Group Touch distinguishes users from each other by modeling whether an interaction
with the tabletop corresponds to either: (1) a new user, or (2) a change in users
currently interacting with the tabletop. This reframing of the challenge as distinguishing
users rather than tracking and identifying them allows Group Touch to support multi-user
collaboration in real-world settings without custom instrumentation. Specifically,
Group Touch examines pairs of touches and uses the difference in orientation, distance,
and time between two touches to determine whether the same person performed both touches
in the pair. Validated with field data from high-school students in a classroom setting,
Group Touch distinguishes among users "in the wild" with a mean accuracy of 92.92%
(SD=3.94%). Group Touch can imbue collaborative touch applications in real-world settings
with the ability to distinguish among multiple users.},

devices. We conducted a mixed methods study including interviews (N = 42) and a survey
(N = 223) to understand how people currently experience events using Facebook Live,
Periscope, and Snapchat Live Stories. We identified four dimensions that make remote
event viewing engaging: immersion, immediacy, interaction, and sociality. We find
that both live streams and the more curated event content found on Snapchat are immersive
and immediate, yet Snapchat Live Stories enable quickly switching among different
views of the event. Live streams, on the other hand, offer real time interaction and
sociality in a way that Snapchat Live Stories do not. However, the interaction's impact
depends on comment volume, comment content, and relationship between viewer and broadcaster.
We describe how people experience events remotely using these social media, and identify
design opportunities around detecting exciting content, leveraging multiple viewpoints,
and enabling interactivity to create engaging user experiences for remotely participating
in events.},

been suggested to reduce this cost for knowledge workers. These approaches predominantly
focus either on a manual and physical indicator, such as headphones or a closed office

a computer-based indicator. Little is known about the combination of a physical indicator
with an automatic interruptibility measure and its long-term impact in the workplace.
In our research, we developed the FlowLight, that combines a physical traffic-light
like LED with an automatic interruptibility measure based on computer interaction
data. In a large-scale and long-term field study with 449 participants from 12 countries,
we found, amongst other results, that the FlowLight reduced the interruptions of participants
by 46%, increased their awareness on the potential disruptiveness of interruptions
and most participants never stopped using it.},

reduce the authoring burden, save senders' time, and maintain recipient engagement

further from the center of the visual field. We therefore conducted a study to examine
the accuracy of popout target identification using different visual variables, each
at five different levels of intensity, and at a wide range of angles from the display
center. Results show that motion is a strong popout stimulus, even at low intensities
and wide angles. Identification accuracy decreases rapidly across visual angle with
other popout stimuli, particularly with shape and color. The findings have relevance
to a wide variety of applications, particularly as multi-display desktop environments
increase in size and visual extent.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the development and testing of a novel, feedback-enabled attention
allocation aid (AAAD), which uses real-time physiological data to improve human performance
in a realistic sequential visual search task. Indeed, by optimizing over search duration,
the aid improves efficiency, while preserving decision accuracy, as the operator identifies
and classifies targets within simulated aerial imagery. Specifically, using experimental
eye-tracking data and measurements about target detectability across the human visual
field, we develop functional models of detection accuracy as a function of search
time, number of eye movements, scan path, and image clutter. These models are then
used by the AAAD in conjunction with real time eye position data to make probabilistic
estimations of attained search accuracy and to recommend that the observer either
move on to the next image or continue exploring the present image. An experimental
evaluation in a scenario motivated from human supervisory control in surveillance
missions confirms the benefits of the AAAD.},

in graphical user interface tasks, including lasso operations in illustration software.
In this work, we conducted several experiments involving joined paths. The results
show that users significantly changed their behavior, and that this strategy change
can be predicted beforehand. A simple model summing the two indexes of difficulty
(IDs) for each path predicts movement time well, but more sophisticated models were
also evaluated. The best model in terms of both of R2 and AIC values includes the
ID of the crossing operation to enter the second path.},

a mouse cursor. Two interface modes were evaluated: constant (CF) and variable friction

modality, target regions were high friction to provide sliding resistance cues. Our
findings confirmed that variable-friction foot-controlled pointing can achieve throughput
competitive with a range of hand-controlled devices. This suggests the potential for
taking advantage of foot input for simple pointing tasks, in particular when the hands
are overloaded. With respect to other foot-controlled pointing systems, our implementation
offered improved performance and comparable error rates. In addition, the analysis
provided further insight into the design of foot-controlled input devices.},

between transmission errors (the received symbol is wrong) and erasures (the received
symbol is empty). Although Fitts' law research has been very much inspired by the
information theoretic rationale, the error/erasure distinction has escaped attention
so far: Target misses have always been treated as normally-distributed errors, through
the effective index of difficulty IDe. The paper introduces a new index of difficulty
based on the simple observation that a target miss conveys zero bit of information,
i.e., it is an erasure. Not only is the new index more consistent with the fundamentals
of information theory, it is much simpler to derive than the ISO-recommended IDe.},

"implications for adoption" into HCI research practice. Implications for adoption
are speculations which may be used in research projects to scrutinize and explore
the implications and requirements associated with a technology's potential adoption
in the future. There is a rich tradition within the HCI community of implementing,
demonstrating, and testing new interactions or technologies by building prototypes.
User-centered design methods help us to develop prototypes to and move toward designs
that are validated, efficient, and rewarding to use. However, these studies rarely
shift their temporal focus to consider, in any significant detail, what it would mean
for a technology to exist beyond its prototypical implementation, in other words how
these prototypes might ultimately be adopted. Given the CHI community's increasing
interest in technology-related human and social effects, the lack of attention paid
to adoption represents a significant and relevant gap in current practices. It is
this gap that the paper addresses and in doing so offers three contributions: (1)
exploring and unpacking different notions of adoption from varying disciplinary perspectives;
(2) discussing why considering adoption is relevant and useful, specifically in HCI
research; (3) discussing methods for addressing this need, specifically design fiction,
and understanding how utilizing these methods may provide researchers with means to
better understand the myriad of nuanced, situated, and technologically-mediated relationships
that innovative designs facilitate.},

we conducted a survey of current UX practitioners with regards to how new ML services

not have been a part of their UX design education, on how they work to create new
things with developers, and on the challenges they have faced working with this material.
We use the findings from this survey and our review of related literature to present
a series of challenges for UX and interaction design research and education. Finally,
we discuss areas where new research and new curriculum might help our community unlock

were analyzed. Use and ownership were ubiquitous, but students demonstrated variability
in coping with the inevitable; disconnection was more burdensome for low-resourced
students. Findings extend technology maintenance and are leveraged as a starting point
for three calls for action in HCI: 1) the CHI community should research the burdens
of poverty in poor and wealthy contexts; 2) new HCI projects should accommodate inconsistent
access; and, 3) new design choices should minimize disruption and optimize stability.
This requires action at the individual and organizational level as designers create
products that consider marginalization but also use expertise to influence policy.},

adoption. However, indepth understanding is crucial for reducing barriers early in

contribute to a better understanding of factors affecting data glasses adoption, as
well as current trends and opinions. Our multiple-year case study (N=118) shows, against
expectations, no significant change towards a more positive attitude between 2014
and 2016. We complement these findings with an expert survey (N=51) investigating
prognoses, challenges and discussing the relevance of social acceptability. We elicit

objections can be overwritten. Our analysis shows that while social acceptability
is considered relevant for the time being, utility and usability are more valued for
long-term adoption.},

resolve access-denied issues. A correct resolution should only permit the expected
access, while maintaining the protection against illegal access. However, anecdotal
evidence suggests that correct resolutions are occasional---sysadmins often grant
too much access (known as security misconfigurations) to allow the denied access,
posing severe security risks. This paper presents a quantitative study on real-world
practices of resolving access-denied issues, with a particular focus on how and why
security misconfigurations are introduced during problem solving. We characterize
the real-world security misconfigurations introduced in the field, and show that many
of these misconfigurations were the results of trial-and-error practices commonly
adopted by sysadmins to work around access denials. We argue that the lack of adequate
feedback information is one fundamental reason that prevents sysadmins from developing
precise understanding and thus induces trial and error. Our study on access-denied
messages shows that many of today's software systems miss the opportunities for providing
adequate feedback information, imposing unnecessary obstacles to correct resolutions.},

Second, we conduct an online survey to examine how different interactions with the
UI affect users' expectations about whether an app accesses sensitive resources. Our
results suggest that user interactions such as button clicks can be interpreted as

abstract = {Gestures have recently gained interest as a secure and usable authentication method
for mobile devices. Gesture authentication relies on recognition, wherein raw data
is collected from user input and preprocessed into a more manageable form before applying
recognition algorithms. Preprocessing is done to improve recognition accuracy, but
little work has been done in justifying its effects on authentication. We examined
the effects of three variables: location, rotation, and scale, on authentication accuracy.
We found that an authentication-optimal combination (location invariant, scale variant,
and rotation variant) can reduce the error rate by 45.3% on average compared to the
recognition-optimal combination (all invariant). We analyzed 13 gesture recognizers

and sending out an email to tell users that they need to reset their password to unlock
their account. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of this security practice based
on the password reset email that LinkedIn sent out around May 2016, and through an
online survey conducted on 249 LinkedIn users who received that email. Our evaluation
shows that only about 46% of the participants reset their passwords. The mean time
taken to reset password was 26.3 days, revealing that a significant proportion of
the participants reset their password a few weeks, or even months after first receiving
the email. Our findings suggest that more effective persuasive measures need to be
added to convince users to reset their password in a timely manner, and further reduce
the risks associated with delaying password resets.},

in situations where the vehicle is unable to operate safely. Currently, such handover
requests require the driver to take control almost instantaneously. We investigate
how auditory pre-alerts that occur well before the handover request impact the success
of the handover in a dual task scenario. In a study with a driving simulator, drivers
perform tasks on their phone while the car is in an autonomous mode. They receive
a repeated burst audio pre-alert or an increasing pulse audio pre-alert preceding
the standard warning for immediate handover. Results show that pre-alerts caused people
to look more at the road before the handover occurred, and to disengage from the secondary
task earlier, compared to when there was no pre-alert. This resulted in safer handover
situations. Increasing pulse pre-alerts show particular promise due to their communication
of urgency. Our detailed analysis informs the design and evaluation of alerts in safety-critical
systems with automation.},

abstract = {Until vehicles are fully autonomous, safety, legal and ethical obligations require
that drivers remain aware of the driving situation. Key decisions about whether a
driver can take over when the vehicle is confused, or its capabilities are degraded,
depend on understanding whether he or she is responsive and aware of external conditions.
The leading techniques for measuring situation awareness in simulated environments
are ill-suited to autonomous driving scenarios, and particularly to on-road testing.
We have developed a technique, named Daze, to measure situation awareness through
real-time, in-situ event alerts. The technique is ecologically valid: it resembles
applications people use in actual driving. It is also flexible: it can be used in
both simulator and on-road research settings. We performed simulator-based and on-road
test deployments to (a) check that Daze could characterize drivers' awareness of their
immediate environment and (b) understand practical aspects of the technique's use.
Our contributions include the Daze technique, examples of collected data, and ways
to analyze such data.},

Wearables (for play): wearables designed to require shared attention and mutual awareness,
with interdependent functionality that encourages and rewards collocated interaction.
The concept arose through design, development, and public exhibition of Hotaru, a
collocated social game that uses wearables as game controllers. Hotaru has been shown
in festivals and also formally playtested with 62 individuals. To more fully articulate
the Interdependent Wearables strong concept, we compared this system's design with
wearable and embodied systems for play and other purposes, and drew upon relevant
HCI theory. The work is of benefit to those in the HCI/UX community focused on the
design and development of social wearable technologies, especially those interested
in supporting collocated interaction.},

They are portrayed as universal templates, portable across national borders and applicable
to local needs. We draw from our ethnographic engagements with tech entrepreneurial
efforts in Ghana, China, and Jamaica to unpack the stakes involved in their uptake,
showing that while local actors produce situated alternatives, their work nevertheless
often results in a continued valorization of these seemingly universal methods. We
argue that design methods shape not only use practices, but have consequences for
the life worlds of professional designers. This includes how they impact personal
and national identities, confer legitimacy in transnational innovation circles, and
secure access to social and economic resources. Ultimately, we call for an inclusion
of these factors in ongoing conversations about design and design methods.},

new technology that can precisely produce functional, rigid objects with custom geometry.
Combining 3D printing and textiles opens up new opportunities for rapidly creating
rigid objects with embedded flexibility as well as soft materials imbued with additional
functionality. In this paper, we introduce a suite of techniques for integrating 3D
printing with textiles during the printing process, opening up a new design space
that takes inspiration from both fields. We demonstrate how the malleability, stretchability

can be augmented with functional properties enabled by 3D printing.},

evaluate existing conversational aids, and 3) design three new SATs. Through the use

ambiguities in humans' status and ensure the flow of the conversation. In particular,
we define four novel types of engagement status and propose a real-time engagement
inference model that weighs humans' social signals dynamically according to the involvement
of the computing devices. We further design two robot behavior strategies (explicit
and implicit) to help resolve uncertainties in engagement inference and mitigate the
impact of uncoupling, based on an annotated human-human interaction video corpus.
We conducted a within-subject experiment to assess the efficacy and usefulness of
the proposed engagement inference model and behavior strategies. Results show that
robots with our engagement model can deliver better service and smoother conversations
as an assistant, and people find the implicit strategy more polite and appropriate.},

abstract = {"Remind me to get milk later this afternoon." In communications and planning, people
often express uncertainty about time using imprecise temporal expressions (ITEs).
Unfortunately, modern virtual assistants often lack system support to capture the
intents behind these expressions. This can result in unnatural interactions and undesirable
interruptions (e.g., having a work reminder delivered at 12pm when out at lunch, because
the user said "this afternoon"). In this paper we explore existing practices, expectations,
and preferences surrounding the use of ITEs. Our mixed methods approach employs surveys,
interviews, and an analysis of a large corpus of written communications. We find that
people frequently use a diverse set of ITEs in both communication and planning. These
uses reflect a variety of motivations, such as conveying uncertainty or task priority.
In addition, we find that people have a variety of expectations about time input and
management when interacting with virtual assistants. We conclude with design implications
for future virtual assistants.},

raise questions about voice control as a smart-home interface, and suggest that embodied
social robots could provide for an engaging interface with high situation awareness,

loss apps. While these apps can be beneficial to users, they can also have negative
effects on users with eating disorder behaviors. Yet few research studies have looked
at weight loss apps in relation to eating disorders. In order to fill this gap, we
conducted interviews with 16 women with a history of eating disorders who use(d) weight
loss apps. While our findings suggest these apps can contribute to and exacerbate
eating disorder behaviors, they also reveal a more complex picture of app usage. Women's
use and perceptions of weight loss apps shift as they experience life and move to
and from stages of change. This research troubles the binary view of technology and
emphasizes the importance of looking at technology use as a dynamic process. Our study

Float, a user tilts the wrist to point and performs an in-air finger tap to click.
To realize Float, we first explore the appropriate motion space for wrist tilt and
determine the clicking action (finger tap) through a user-elicitation study. We combine
the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal with accelerometer and gyroscope to detect finger
taps with a recall of 97.9% and a false discovery rate of 0.4%. Experiments show that
using just one hand, Float allows users to acquire targets with size ranging from
2mm to 10mm in less than 2s to 1s, meanwhile achieve much higher accuracy than direct
touch in both stationary (&gt;98.9%) and walking (&gt;71.5%) contexts.},

within the HCI community in recent years. These developments suggest that the HCI
community should engage with and respond to concerns that are external to computing

contexts into account yields a fundamentally different way to think about sustainable
interaction design, one in which the designer's focus must be on a) ecological limits,
b) creating designs and artifacts that do not further a cornucopian paradigm, and
c) fundamental human needs.It can be hard to be responsive to these contexts in practical
HCI work. To address this, we propose that the design rubric of disintermediation
can serve as a unifying approach for work that aims to meet the ecological and economic
challenges outlined in the literature. After discussing the potential use and impact

In other words, digital financial platforms are proving capable of supporting new
relations between groups of people as well as offering new ways to organize money.
Taking an HCI lens, we look at how some crowdfunding platform owners are approaching
social innovation, not only at the level of supporting individual community initiatives,
but at the broader level of using their platform to change societal behavior. Through
four case studies, we show how crowdfunding has been chosen as a tool to redesign
society by promoting environmental or social sustainability. We argue that the groups
constituted through these interactions are not merely "crowds", but deliberate constellations
built round a thing of interest (or "paying publics"). Our interviews with managers
and owners explore how interactions with and around platforms work to achieve these
ends and we conclude with design considerations.},

by new stakeholders across diverse sectors. Yet with this evolution in hackathons,
we no longer adequately understand what is produced and, thereby, the value of these

of nonprofit organizations, and organizers - of the CHI4Good Day of Service to understand
what is produced through philanthropic hackathons. Whereas traditional hackathons
are oriented around the production of code or prototypes, our analysis of interview
data suggests that the production work of philanthropic hackathons also includes technical
capacity and expertise, expanded social networks, an exposure to design process, affective
experiences, and an opportunity for participants to shape their identities against
a cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary backdrop. We conclude by reflecting on implications
for the CHI community in carrying out philanthropic events styled after hackathons.},

results show non-expert individuals create concept maps differently to visualisation

weather forecast before deciding what to wear. Due to their uncertainty, such forecasts
can differ by provider. To make an informed decision, many people compare several
forecasts, which is a time-consuming and cumbersome task. To facilitate comparison,
we identified three aggregation mechanisms for forecasts: manual comparison and two
mechanisms of computational aggregation. In a survey, we compared the mechanisms using
different representations. We then developed a weather application to evaluate the
most promising candidates in a real-world study. Our results show that aggregation
increases users' confidence in uncertain data, independent of the type of representation.
Further, we find that for daily events, users prefer to use computationally aggregated
forecasts. However, for high-stakes events, they prefer manual comparison. We discuss
how our findings inform the design of improved interfaces for comparison of uncertain
data, including non-weather purposes.},

To investigate potentials of an end-user development (EUD) approach for flexibly supporting

in 12 households as part of a Living Lab study. Results are based on three interview

as procedures, treatments, and medications; (2) to learn about healthcare providers;
(3) to report and prevent medical errors; (4) to exchange emotional support; and (5)
to manage their time in the hospital. In this paper, we examine these themes and describe

it allows users to personalize the designs by (1) specifying joint positions and part
segmentations, (2) defining joint types and motion ranges to build a wire-based skeletal
model, and (3) abstracting the segmented meshes into mixed-dimensional appearance
patterns or attachments.The WireFab is designed to allow the user to choose how to
best preserve the fidelity of the topological structure and articulation motion while
selectively maintaining the fidelity of the geometric appearance. Compared to 3D-printing
based high-fidelity fabrication systems, WireFab increases prototyping speed by ignoring
unnecessary geometric details while preserving structural integrity and articulation
motion. In addition, other rapid or low-fidelity fabrication systems produce only
static models, while WireFab produces posable articulated models and has the potential
to enable personalized functional products larger than the machines that produce them.},

embedded spring discharges and the resulting impulse triggers one or more neighboring
cells, resulting in signal propagation. We extend this basic mechanism to implement
simple logic functions. We demonstrate interactive objects based on this concept,

abstract = {In this paper we present Organic Primitives, an enabling toolbox that expands upon
the library of input-output devices in HCI and facilitates the design of interactions
with organic, fluid-based systems. We formulated color, odor and shape changing material
primitives which act as sensor-actuators that convert pH signals into human-readable
outputs. Food-grade organic molecules anthocyanin, vanillin, and chitosan were employed
as dopants to synthesize materials which output a spectrum of colors, degrees of shape
deformation, and switch between odorous and non-odorous states. We evaluated the individual
output properties of our sensor-actuators to assess the rate, range, and reversibility
of the changes as a function of pH 2-10. We present a design space with techniques
for enhancing the functionality of the material primitives, and offer passive and
computational methods for controlling the material interfaces. Finally, we explore
applications enabled by Organic Primitives under four contexts: environmental, cosmetic,
edible, and interspecies.},

operate on capacitive touchscreens. Flexibles add expressive deformation input to
interaction with on-screen tangibles. Based on different types of deformation mapping,
we contribute a set of 3D-printable mechanisms that capture pressing, squeezing, and
bending input with multiple levels of intensities. They can be integrated into 3D
printed objects with custom geometries and on different locations. A Flexible is printed
in a single pass on a consumer-level 3D printer without requiring further assembly.
Through a series of interactive prototypes, example applications and a technical evaluation,
we show the technical feasibility and the wide applicability of Flexibles.},

abstract = {Persuasive games and gamified systems are effective tools for motivating behavior
change using various persuasive strategies. Research has shown that tailoring these
systems can increase their efficacy. However, there is little knowledge on how game-based
persuasive systems can be tailored to individuals of various personality traits. To
advance research in this area, we conducted a large-scale study of 660 participants
to investigate how different personalities respond to various persuasive strategies
that are used in persuasive health games and gamified systems. Our results reveal
that people's personality traits play a significant role in the perceived persuasiveness
of different strategies. Conscientious people tend to be motivated by goal setting,
simulation, self-monitoring and feedback; people who are more open to experience are
more likely to be demotivated by rewards, competition, comparison, and cooperation.
We contribute to the CHI community by offering design guidelines for tailoring persuasive
games and gamified designs to a particular group of personalities.},

abstract = {Many game designers aim to optimize difficulty to make games that are "not too hard,
not too easy." However, recent experiments have shown that even moderate difficulty
can reduce player engagement. The present work investigates other design factors that
may account for the purported benefits of difficulty, such as choice, novelty and
suspense. These factors were manipulated in three design experiments involving over
20,000 play sessions of an online educational game.The first experiment (n=10,472)
randomly assigned some players to a particular level of difficulty but allowed other
players to freely choose their difficulty. Moderately difficult levels were most motivating
when self-selected; yet, when difficulty was blindly assigned, the easiest games were
most motivating. The second experiment (n=5,065) randomly assigned players to differing
degrees of novelty. Moderate novelty was optimal, while too much or too little novelty
reduced intrinsic motivation. A final experiment (n=6,511) investigated the role of
suspense in "close games", where it was found to be beneficial. If difficulty decreases
motivation while novelty and suspense increase it, then an implication for educational
game designers is to make easy, interesting games that are "not too hard, not too
boring."},

abstract = {Games user research (GUR) measures the performance and preference of digital game
players, and interprets these measurements in the context of theories that explain
human behavior. There are many validated approaches for measuring player experience
that are grounded in psychological theories on motivation and emotion. Attribution
theory explains how people assign causes to events and how these attributions affect
peoples' emotional reactions and motivations. In this paper we argue that attribution
theory can provide additional value to the existing suite of GUR tools; however, there
are currently no validated tools to assess player attribution in the context of games.
This paper describes the conceptualization of player attribution based on literature,
presents the development and validation of a scale to assess player attribution in
games, and discusses the implications of adding player attribution to the toolbox
of methods for the design and evaluation of digital games.},

fitness as an attempt to promote exercise and more active life styles. Motivated by
popularity and availability of wearable activity trackers, we present the design and
findings of a study on the motivational effects of using activity tracker-based games
to promote daily exercise. Furthermore, we have investigated user behaviors, usage
patterns, engagement, and parameters that affect them. An exergame was developed with
an accompanying wearable device, for which different variations of application updates
were pushed out periodically over a 70-day period. The results of this long-term study
show that the usage of wearable activity trackers during exercise, even when gamified
for increased entertainment, sees a consistent decline over time. This decline, however,
is observed to be reversible with periodic updates to the game. This work, we believe,
can make a significant contribution to solving the user retention problem of wearable-based
exergames.},

Our work consists of three stages: design ideation and review, an in-lab user study
with 10 participants resulting in nine candidate interfaces, and a 3 week field trial
of two further honed measures with 12 participants. This research firstly yields a
better understanding of participants' strong and sometimes contrasting preferences
regarding their self-assessment of pain intensity. We additionally contribute two
novel interfaces that support accurate, quick, and repeated use along with other participant-valued
interactions (e.g., familiar, relatable, and highly usable). In particular, we focus
on designing tailored measures that both enhance respondent motivation as well as
minimize the difficulty of meaningful self-assessment by supporting the cognitive
effort in translating a subjective experience into a single numerical value.},

mobile application containing video-based branching anaphylaxis narratives. We trialed
the intervention with 36 nut allergic adolescents. At 1-year follow-up participants
had improved adrenaline auto-injector skills and carriage, disease- and age-specific
Quality of Life and confidence in anaphylaxis management. At 3-year follow-up adrenaline
carriage improved further and confidence remained higher. Participants expressed how
the education session was a turning point in taking control of their allergy and how
the app facilitated sharing about anaphylaxis with others. We contribute insights
regarding design of mobile self-care and peer-support applications for health in adolescence,
and discuss strengths and limitations of video-based mobile health interventions.},
