abstract = { We present an inexpensive tabletop loom that offers fully computational patterning
while maintaining the flexibility of handweaving. Our loom can be assembled for under
US$200 with 3D printed parts, and it can be controlled straightforwardly over USB.
Our loom is explicitly a hand loom: that is, a weaver is required to operate the weaving
process and may mediate row-by-row patterning and material specifics like yarn tension.
Our approach combines the flexibility of fully analog handweaving with the computational
affordances of digital fabrication: it enables the incorporation of special techniques
and materials, as well as allowing for the possibility of computational and creative
interventions in the weaving process itself. In taking this approach, we aim to serve
a range of end users including artisans and researchers, whether for skill-building,
for rapid prototyping, or for creative reflection. We describe the mechanical and
electronic implementation of our loom and show examples of its use for personal fabrication.},

producing multilayer spacer fabrics. These fabrics consist of two face layers connected

how to vary knit patterning and yarn parameters in spacer fabrics to produce tactile
materials with embedded functionality for forming soft actuated mechanisms and sensors
with tunable density, stiffness, material bias, and bristle properties. These soft
mechanisms can be rapidly produced on a computationally-controlled v-bed knitting

homogeneity, signal-to-noise ratio, sensing range, and washability. Finally, we demonstrate
two use case scenarios, primarily focusing on continuous input with up to three degrees-of-freedom.},

Based on a review of popular books on improvisational quilting, a set of design principles

was developed to support the unique aspects of this process. An evaluation with a

BezelGlide (PBG), use the full or a portion of the bezel, respectively, to reduce
screen occlusion while scanning a line chart for data. In the common value detection

both quantitatively and subjectively, also while mobile. We finally illustrate the
generzability potential of PBG to interact with common graph types making it a valuable

abstract = {We propose a novel type of olfactory device that creates a stereo-smell experience,
i.e., directional information about the location of an odor, by rendering the readings
of external odor sensors as trigeminal sensations using electrical stimulation of
the user's nasal septum. The key is that the sensations from the trigeminal nerve,
which arise from nerve-endings in the nose, are perceptually fused with those of the
olfactory bulb (the brain region that senses smells). As such, we propose that electrically
stimulating the trigeminal nerve is an ideal candidate for stereo-smell augmentation/substitution
that, unlike other approaches, does not require implanted electrodes in the olfactory
bulb. To realize this, we engineered a self-contained device that users wear across
their nasal septum. Our device outputs by stimulating the user's trigeminal nerve
using electrical impulses with variable pulse-widths; and it inputs by sensing the
user's inhalations using a photoreflector. It measures 10x23 mm and communicates with
external gas sensors using Bluetooth. In our user study, we found the key electrical
waveform parameters that enable users to feel an odor's intensity (absolute electric
charge) and direction (phase order and net charge). In our second study, we demonstrated
that participants were able to localize a virtual smell source in the room by using
our prototype without any previous training. Using these insights, our device enables
expressive trigeminal sensations and could function as an assistive device for people
with anosmia, who are unable to smell.},

the waist as a new eyes-free and hands-free input method for both the physical world
and the virtual world. We first conducted a user study (N=12) to understand users’
ability to control their waist. We found that users could easily discriminate eight
shifting directions and two rotating orientations, and quickly confirm actions by
returning to the original position (quick return). We developed a design space with
eight gestures for waist interaction based on the results and implemented an IMU-based
real-time system. Using a hierarchical machine learning model, our system could recognize
waist gestures at an accuracy of 97.5%. Finally, we conducted a second user study
(N=12) for usability testing in both real-world scenarios and virtual reality settings.
Our usability study indicated that HulaMove significantly reduced interaction time
by 41.8% compared to a touch screen method, and greatly improved users’ sense of presence
in the virtual world. This novel technique provides an additional input method when
users’ eyes or hands are busy, accelerates users’ daily operations, and augments their

freehand inking with digital support: projected in-situ guidance assists creating
valid on-body circuits and aesthetic ornaments that align with the human bodyscape,
while pro-active switching between inking and non-inking creates error preventing
constraints. We contribute BodyStylus’s design rationale and interaction concept along
with an interactive prototype that uses self-sintering conductive ink. Results of
two focus group explorations showed that guidance was more appreciated by artists,

inspired critical reflection on the relationship between bodyscape, interaction, and

of an NFC tag at a high read rate (∼ 300 reads/s) with low latency, but such high-speed

limited to a discrete, hands-on interaction style using one tag at a time. In this
work, we realized fluent, hands-off, and multi-tag tangible interactions by leveraging
gravity and anti-collision physical constraints, which support effortless user input
and maximize throughput. Furthermore, our system provides hot-swappable interactivity
that enables smooth transitions throughout extended use. Based on the design parameters

experience, while Joint-actuation was interpreted as a collaborative experience. The
interaction paradigms also influenced the intensity of emotions and perception of
control, with Joint-actuation leading to more intense emotions and higher sensitivity
to control in the interaction. To conclude, our findings show that it is possible
to design an actuated-interface that users perceive both as a tangible interface and

that shedding tears would induce emotional contagion because it is observable by others.
We designed an eyeglasses-style wearable device, Teardrop glasses, that release water
drops near the wearer’s eyes. The drops flow down the cheeks and emulate real tears.
The study revealed that artificial crying with pseudo tears increased sadness among
both wearers and those observing them. Moreover, artificial crying attenuated happiness

not necessary for inducing emotional contagion as artificial bodily changes are also
sufficient. },

Heads-Up-Displays (HUDs) provide an opportunity to visually inform drivers about vehicle

may be to reveal to drivers the vehicle’s full contextual understanding, though it
is not clear if the benefits of additional information outweigh the drawbacks of added
complexity, or if this balance holds across drivers. We designed and tested an Augmented
Reality (AR) HUD in an online study (N = 298), focusing on the influence of HUD visualizations
on drivers’ situation awareness and perceptions. Participants viewed two driving scenes
with one of three HUD conditions. Results were nuanced: situation awareness declined
with increasing driving context complexity, and contrary to expectation, also declined
with the presence of a HUD compared to no HUD. Significant differences were found
by varying HUD complexity, which led us to explore different characterizations of
complexity, including counts of scene items, item categories, and illuminated pixels.
Our analysis finds that driving style interacts with driving context and HUD complexity,

experiences. However, as users watch one part of the 360° view, they will necessarily
miss out on events happening in other parts of the sphere. Consequently, fear of missing
out (FOMO) is unavoidable. However, users can also experience the joy of missing out
(JOMO). In a repeated measures, mixed methods design, we examined the fear and joy
of missing out (FOMO and JOMO) and sense of presence in two repeat viewings of a 360°
film using a head-mounted display. We found that users experienced both FOMO and JOMO.
FOMO was caused by the users’ awareness of parallel events in the spherical view,
but users also experienced JOMO. FOMO did not compromise viewers’ sense of presence,
and FOMO also decreased in the second viewing session, while JOMO remained constant.
The findings suggest that FOMO and JOMO can be two integral qualities in an immersive
video viewing experience and that FOMO may not be as negative a factor as previously
thought. },

abstract = {Graphical User Interfaces present commands at particular locations, arranged in menus,
toolbars, and ribbons. One hallmark of expertise with a GUI is that experts know the
locations of commonly-used commands, such that they can find them quickly and without
searching. Although GUIs have been studied for many years, however, there is still
little known about how this spatial location memory develops, or how designers can
make interfaces more memorable. One of the main ways that people remember locations
in the real world is landmarks – so we carried out a study to investigate how users
remember commands and navigate in four common applications (Word, Facebook, Reader,
and Photoshop). Our study revealed that people strongly rely on landmarks that are
readily available in the interface (e.g., layout, corners, and edges) to orient themselves
and remember commands. We provide new evidence that landmarks can aid spatial memory
and expertise development with an interface, and guidelines for designers to improve
the memorability of future GUIs.},

under ideal conditions, there is little evidence that they can lead to underlying
markers of physiological benefit under interrupted work conditions. Further, even
if guides are effective during work tasks, it is unclear how personal and workplace
factors affect peoples' willingness to adopt them for everyday use. In this paper,
we present the results of a comparative, mixed-methods study of five different peripheral
breathing guides. Our findings show that peripheral breathing guides are viable and
can provide physiological markers of benefit during interrupted work. Further, we
show that guides are effective – even when use is intermittent due to workplace distractions.
Finally, we contribute guidelines to support the design of breathing guides for everyday

explore how accurately users can be identified during two task-driven scenarios based
on their spatial movement. We show that an identification accuracy of up to 90% is
possible across sessions recorded on different days. Moreover, we investigate the
role of users’ physiology in behavioral biometrics by virtually altering and normalizing
their body proportions. We find that body normalization in general increases the identification

compute camera movements and reduces FoV during rapid motion or optical flow. A user
study (N=23) comparing 360° video with unrestricted-FoVs (90°), reduced fixed-FoVs

can be modelled by separating design factors from subjective measures. We discuss

easy to interact with multiple distant spaces as well as nearby objects. Proxies themselves
become part of the scene and can be moved, rotated, scaled, or anchored to other objects.
Furthermore, they can be used in a set of higher-level interactions such as alignment
and action duplication. We show how Poros enables a variety of tasks and applications

scheme, and report on results from: (1) a lab-based in-VR usability study (N=20) evaluating
user performance; (2) an online security study (N=22) evaluating system’s observation
resistance through virtual avatars; and (3) a comparison between our results and those
previously reported in the real-world evaluation. Our analysis indicates that VR can
serve as a suitable test-bed for human-centred evaluations of real-world authentication
schemes, but the used VR technology can have an impact on the evaluation. Our work
is a first step towards augmenting the design and evaluation spectrum of authentication
systems and offers ground work for more research to follow. },

abstract = { In today’s fast-paced world, stress has become a growing health concern. While more
automatic stress tracking technologies have recently become available on wearable
or mobile devices, there is still a limited understanding of how they are actually
used in everyday life. This paper presents an empirical study of automatic stress-tracking
technologies in use in China, based on semi-structured interviews with 17 users. The
study highlights three challenges of stress-tracking data engagement that prevent
effective technology usage: the lack of immediate awareness, the lack of pre-required
knowledge, and the lack of corresponding communal support. Drawing on the stress-tracking
practices uncovered in the study, we bring these issues to the fore, and unpack assumptions
embedded in related works on self-tracking and how data engagement is approached.
We end by calling for a reconsideration of data engagement as part of self-tracking
practices with technologies rather than simply looking at the user interface. },

mental wellbeing. An immediate cue of such improvement is support-seekers’ satisfaction
expressed in their replies to the received comments. However, the comments that seekers
find satisfying may change with their community knowledge, e.g., measured by tenure
and posting experience in that community. In this paper, we first model the amount
of satisfaction conveyed in the support-seekers’ replies to the received comments.
Then we quantitatively examine how seekers’ expressed satisfaction is affected by
their community knowledge, sought and received support in an OMHC. Results show that
support-seekers with more posting experience generally display less contentment to
the received comments. Compared to newcomers, higher tenured members express less
satisfaction when receiving informational support. We also found that support matching
positively predicts seekers’ satisfaction regardless of their community knowledge.
Our findings have implications for OMHCs to satisfy support-seekers through their
community knowledge.},

to both users’ preference and their actual usage of a mental well-being app. Furthermore,
we explored users’ preference in sharing their data for receiving personalised recommendations,
by juxtaposing questionnaires and mobile sensor data. Interestingly, self-reported
results indicate the preference for personalised guidance, whereas behavioural data
suggests that a blend of autonomous choice and recommended activities results in higher
engagement. Additionally, although users reported a strong preference of filling out
questionnaires instead of sharing their mobile data, the data source did not have
any impact on the actual app use. We discuss the implications of our findings and
provide takeaways for designers of mental well-being applications. },

the importance of learning how to properly behave with technology, e.g., through educational

IMU-embedded toy blocks. Play data collected from 78 preschoolers revealed that specific

behavior in children. The results align with our qualitative observations, and suggest
the potential of predicting the clinical behavior problems of children based on short

facilitate disclosures about silenced topics by enabling selective disclosure, enabling
proxy content moderation, providing education about silenced experiences, and prioritizing
such disclosures in news feeds. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy

the decision, effectively making the decision-making process more heuristic. In our
analysis of an existing dataset of scenario-based smart home privacy decisions, we
demonstrate that defaults and framing not only have a direct effect on participants’
decisions; they also moderate the effect of their cognitive appraisals of the presented
scenarios on the decision. These results suggest that nudges like defaults and framing
exacerbate the well-researched problem that people often employ heuristics rather
than making deliberate privacy decisions, and that privacy-setting interfaces should

adults facing cognitive challenges requires close collaboration of partners. As part
of research to design a Safety Setting application for older adults with memory loss
or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we use a scenario-based participatory design.
Our study builds on previous findings that couples’ approach to memory loss was characterized
by a desire for flexibility and choice, and an embrace of role uncertainty. We find
that couples don't want a system that fundamentally alters their relationship and
are looking to maximize self-surveillance competence and minimize loss of autonomy
for their partners. All desire Safety Settings to maintain their mutual safety rather
than designating one partner as the target of oversight. Couples are open to more
rigorous surveillance if they have control over what types of activities trigger various
levels of oversight.},

is significantly less profound and often frustrating. This is particularly apparent
in security and privacy experiences: powerlessness, confusion, and annoyance have
all been reported. In order to reduce frustration and help fulfill the promise of
smart homes, we need to explore the experience of security and privacy in situ. We
analyze an ethnographic study observing six UK households over six months to present
a longitudinal view of security and privacy user experiences in smart products. We
find inconsistencies in managing security and privacy, e.g., contrasting the ease
of granting and difficulty of withholding consent. We identify security and privacy
issues in repurposing smart home devices – using devices outside of their initial
intended purposes. We conclude with recommendations for design in smart home devices.

the perceived usefulness and acceptance of feedback and, subsequently, lead to ineffective
design revisions. To enhance the effectiveness of crowdsourced design feedback, we
investigate a new approach for mitigating the effects of negative or positive feedback
by combining open-ended and thought-provoking questions with declarative feedback
statements. We conducted two user studies to assess the effects of question-based
feedback on the sentiment and quality of design revisions in the context of graphic
design. We found that crowdsourced question-based feedback contains more neutral sentiment
than statement-based feedback. Moreover, we provide evidence that presenting feedback
as questions followed by statements leads to better design revisions than question-
or statement-based feedback alone.},

effects that changes may have on the user. A carelessly picked adaptation may impose
high costs to the user – for example, due to surprise or relearning effort – or “trap”
the process to a suboptimal design immaturely. However, effects on users are hard
to predict as they depend on factors that are latent and evolve over the course of
interaction. We propose a novel approach for adaptive user interfaces that yields
a conservative adaptation policy: It finds beneficial changes when there are such
and avoids changes when there are none. Our model-based reinforcement learning method
plans sequences of adaptations and consults predictive HCI models to estimate their
effects. We present empirical and simulation results from the case of adaptive menus,
showing that the method outperforms both a non-adaptive and a frequency-based policy.},

improving prototypes that uses secondary design dimensions to explore a structured
design space. This method is grounded in the cognitive principles of human visual
object recognition. We present VisiFit – a computational design system that uses this
method to enable novice graphic designers to improve blends with computationally generated
options they can select, adjust, and chain together. Our evaluation shows novices
can substantially improve 76% of blends in under 4 minutes. We discuss how the method
can be generalized to other blending problems, and how computational tools can support
novices by enabling them to explore a structured design space quickly and efficiently.

a new self-supervised technique for generating representations in embedding vectors
of GUI screens and components that encode all of the above GUI features without requiring
manual annotation using the context of user interaction traces. Screen2Vec is inspired
by the word embedding method Word2Vec, but uses a new two-layer pipeline informed

metadata. Through several sample downstream tasks, we demonstrate Screen2Vec’s key
useful properties: representing between-screen similarity through nearest neighbors,
composability, and capability to represent user tasks. },

they significantly more frequently select faces with blood flow as more anthropomorphic

We introduce a complementary approach by adapting function structure models from engineering

Function structure models allow designers to understand a system in terms of its functions
and flows between functions and decouple functions from function carriers. Envelope
analysis allows the designer to further study how parameters affect variables of interest,
for example, accuracy, keystroke savings and other dependent variables. We provide
examples of function structure models and illustrate a complete envelope analysis

We discuss the implications of this design approach for both text entry system design

In fact, San Francisco Unified School District voted to stop using and completely

is that the system relies on modeling assumptions about families’ priorities, constraints,

to ideal participation that many families face, particularly because of socioeconomic
inequalities. We argue that direct, ongoing engagement with stakeholders is central

nonhuman organisms. We present results from an interview study with expert bioartists
as well as our hands-on experience in a bioart project where we created poetry-infused
wine by encoding and inserting a Persian Sufi poem into the DNA sequence of living
yeast cells. We find that engaging in bioart practice generates transdisciplinary
fluency with implications for access and activism and our understanding of the qualities
of living media. We further explore the qualitative aspects of interacting directly
with DNA and implications for sustainable futures.},

settings such as schools and libraries. Older adults are one group for whom making
agendas are being pursued, with envisioned outcomes such as supporting agency and
well-being. However, research on making and DIY with older adults typically study
individuals who are already engaged in making practices or bring individuals in to
a technology environment that has already been created. In this paper, we study the
older adult-driven formation of a makerspace in an independent living community. Through
an ethnographically-informed approach, we studied the ways that individuals considered
appropriate allocation of resources towards a makerspace, scoped activities, evaluated
goals, and made trade-offs. Our analysis is centered around describing the way that
this makerspace formed as well as three ways that individuals made sense of the makerspace
as the planning unfolded: the openness of a space that promises to cater to interests
of the population; the promise of a makerspace to involve more residents in technology,
but the need to obscure the technology to make it appealing; and a valuation of the
return on investment for limited financial and space resources. Our discussion contributes
to supporting and studying early adoption of technology by older adults, complicates
visions of “making for all,” and presents considerations regarding the often under-specified
community of a makerspace.},

the PDS, consisting of the beneficiaries, dealers, and state administrators. Drawing
on ethnographic fieldwork, the paper traces the histories of interaction and portraitures
that the three stakeholders bring to their description and interpretation of the POS
machine. It shows that an active POS machine provokes the stakeholders in the PDS
to view it as an artifact that invites engagement on practical, moral, and knowledge
dimensions. The varying ‘biographies’ that stakeholders narrate of the POS machine,
collectively reveal the design, disposition, and functioning of a social justice infrastructure
that rests on the compulsions of biometric technologies to improve inclusion and deter
corruption in welfare delivery.},

show that VR is an inherently ableist technology that assumes a ‘corporeal standard’

create accurate visualizations. Our findings suggest a general indifference towards
the provenance of recommendations, and point to idiosyncratic definitions of visualization

conducted two crowdsourced experiments to study the impact of showing different information

plausibility of unreasonable causal claims. Also, simply warning participants that
correlation is not causation seemed to lead participants to accept reasonable causal
claims more cautiously. We observed a strong tendency among participants to associate
correlation with causation. Yet, the warning appeared to reduce the tendency. Grounded

little is known about how they can be incorporated into narrative visualization. To
bridge this gap, this work introduces the idea of narrative linearity to visualization
and investigates how different narrative orders affect the expressiveness of time-oriented
stories. First, we conducted preliminary interviews with seven experts to clarify
the motivations and challenges of manipulating narrative linearity in time-oriented
stories. Then, we analyzed a corpus of 80 time-oriented stories and identified six
most salient patterns of narrative orders. Next, we conducted a crowdsourcing study
with 221 participants. Results indicated that anachronies have the potential to make
time-oriented stories more expressive without hindering comprehensibility.},

allowing users to interact with a static visualization can improve their reasoning.
Through two crowdsourced studies, we show that adding interaction to a static Bayesian
reasoning visualization does not improve participants’ accuracy on a Bayesian reasoning
task. In some cases, it can significantly detract from it. Moreover, we demonstrate
that underlying visualization design modulates performance and that people with high
versus low spatial ability respond differently to different interaction techniques
and underlying base visualizations. Our work suggests that interaction is not as unambiguously
good as we often believe; a well designed static visualization can be as, if not more,
effective than an interactive one. },

experiments that use large samples and a combination of design strategies to maximize

abstract = { This research investigates how people engage with data visualizations when commenting
on the social platform Reddit. There has been considerable research on collaborative
sensemaking with visualizations and the personal relation of people with data. Yet,
little is known about how public audiences without specific expertise and shared incentives
openly express their thoughts, feelings, and insights in response to data visualizations.
Motivated by the extensive social exchange around visualizations in online communities,
this research examines characteristics and motivations of people’s reactions to posts
featuring visualizations. Following a Grounded Theory approach, we study 475 reactions
from the /r/dataisbeautiful community, identify ten distinguishable reaction types,
and consider their contribution to the discourse. A follow-up survey with 168 Reddit
users clarified their intentions to react. Our results help understand the role of
personal perspectives on data and inform future interfaces that integrate audience
reactions into visualizations to foster a public discourse about data. },

abstract = { Infographics range from minimalism that aims to convey the raw data to elaborately
decorated, or embellished, graphics that aim to engage readers by telling a story.
Several studies have shown evidence to negative, but also positive, effects on embellishments.
We conducted a set of experiments to gauge more precisely how embellishments affect
how people relate to infographics and make sense of the conveyed story. By analyzing
questionnaires, interviews, and eye-tracking data simplified by bundling, we show
that, within bounds, embellishments have a positive effect on how users get engaged
in understanding an infographic, with very limited downside. To our knowledge, our
work is the first that fuses the aforementioned three information sources to understand
infographics. Our findings can help to design more fine-grained studies to quantify
the effects of embellishments and also to design infographics that effectively use
the embellishments’ positive aspects identified. I think the contribution does not
appear well in the abstract. It’s not just that the visual embellishments are positive.
We show a methodology that allows us to see what these effects are (in addition to
engagement, memorization and recall) at several levels (scales, interviews, eye tracking)
which are therefore physiological and emotional. We could include this idea in the
abstract?},

abstract = { Synthesis, or the integration of hitherto separated elements, is a prominent concept
in theories of design processes. Synthesis often happens when there is a need to make
a decision, though it is often the result of a combination of different alternatives,
instead of deciding in favor of one and eliminating another. In many design studies,
synthesis has been investigated in the contexts of everyday design—bicycle frames,
sewing machines, commercial architecture. We were interested in how it might apply
in contexts of reflective design, whose pragmatics often depend on different interrelationships
between users and technological products. In this paper, we argue that designing everyday
use objects for reflection requires a synthesis of two apparently opposite forms:
conventionally practical forms, since they are everyday use objects, and evocative
forms, since they make users think. We provide two examples of everyday objects for
reflection that we believe synthesize both conventionally practical and evocative
forms, analyzing the design processes that led to these forms, and discussing how
these reflective designs embody different forms of synthesis.},

abstract = {Speculative design, critical design, and other alternative designs have emerged as
popular approaches and burgeoning traditions within HCI and design research. While
examples of this work abound, comparatively little theory exists for grasping alternative
designs, and for explicating their relation to other types of design and to design
in general. In response this paper develops the key concepts of progressional design,
frictional design, and design as prefiguration. The progressional conceptualization
of design holds that designs have a primary purpose, and that purpose is to ultimately
converge toward and ideally arrive at production. The frictional conceptualization
of design radically relaxes teleological assumptions and productional expectations.
Frictional designs prefigure possibilities that are compellingly resistant to further
progression and final production. Prefiguration grounds both progression and friction
in the idea that designs are partial, provisional, and potentially preliminary actualizations
of possible futures. To illustrate frictional design, this paper outlines a framework
of 5 frictional tendencies: diverging, opposing, accelerating, counterfactualizing,
and analogizing. These tendencies represent ways in which frictional designs are directionally
in tension with the arrow-like vector of progressional design. Several additional
concepts are discussed in conclusion to further explicate more nuanced relational
potentials between friction and progression: transproductional uses, teleological
ambiguity, and relational multiplicity.},

Through observations and conversations with participants during several showings,

light of the norms and constraints that are imposed by social behaviours and by the

where people break free from those norms, embrace eccentricity and dare to dance.

field recording, which enabled immersive "ecological" experiences. We offer (1) an

creative activities. We depict making un-use as transformational acts, and discuss
epistemological and designerly consequences of making un-use to shed light on a not

abstract = { This work introduces “destaining” as an interactive component for the HCI community.
While staining happens unintentionally (e.g., spilling coffee), destaining can be
used as an intentional design tool that selectively degrades stains on textiles. We
explore the design space using silver doped titanium dioxide (TiO2/Ag), stains and
light as a set of design primitives for interactive systems. We then developed replicable
and accessible fabrication and testing methods that enable HCI researchers and designers
to upgrade various fabrics to self-destaining textiles. Next, we demonstrate a Self-deStaining
textile interface with embedded Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and moisture sensors
that activate cleaning. Lastly, we showcase how the textile can be used in everyday
objects such as self-cleaning clothes, a patterning station for phone cases, and accessories
that change patterns and colors based on the user’s experiences.},

a range of conversational agents, including chatbots and voice assistants. Although
guidelines have been proposed, there is not yet an established set of usability heuristics
to guide and evaluate conversational agent design. In this paper, we propose a set
of heuristics for conversational agents adapted from Nielsen’s heuristics and based
on expert feedback. We then validate the heuristics through two rounds of evaluations
conducted by participants on two conversational agents, one chatbot and one voice-based
personal assistant. We find that, when using our heuristics to evaluate both interfaces,
evaluators were able to identify more usability issues than when using Nielsen’s heuristics.
We propose that our heuristics successfully identify issues related to dialogue content,
interaction design, help and guidance, human-like characteristics, and data privacy.},

implications for developing VUIs that initiate dialogue and provide feedback in ways
that better facilitate children’s language learning.},

abstract = {Sexual assault survivors hesitate to disclose their stories to others and even avoid
case-reporting because of psychological, social, and cultural reasons. Thus, conversational
agents (CAs) have gained much attention as a potential counselor because CAs’ characteristics
(e.g., anonymity) could mitigate various difficulties of human-human interaction (HHI).
Despite the potentials, it is difficult to design a CA for survivors because various
aspects should be considered. Especially, with traditional HCI approaches only (e.g.,
need-finding and usability tests), designers could easily miss psychological and subjective
burdens that survivors feel toward a new system. Hence, while envisioning a burden-free
CA for survivors, we agilely designed and implemented an initial prototype CA (NamuBot)
with professionals (the police and counselors). We then conducted a qualitative user
study to identify and compare burdens caused by the CA vs. humans. Lastly, we codesigned
design features that could reduce the CA-bound burdens with 36 participants (19 survivors
and 17 professionals). Notably, our findings showed that 17 survivors preferred reporting
their case to NamuBot over humans, expressing far less burden. Although CAs could
also place burdens on survivors, the burdens could be alleviated by the features that
the survivors and professionals designed. Finally, we present design implications
and strategies to develop burden-mitigating CAs for survivors.},

interactivity and functionality that create a complex design process, making the form
exploration challenging. Various wearable prototyping tools were developed to overcome
this challenge; however, they are usually textile-based and do not target smart jewelry
design. To bridge this gap, we developed Snowflakes that differentiates from existing
tools by 1) allowing designers to explore different jewelry forms, 2) incorporating
external materials such as leather, 3) creating form factors that fit body parts with
flexible connectors. In this paper, we explain the design process of Snowflakes which
is inspired by 7 design parameters (limbs, materials, grip, fastener, decoration,
placement, form) extracted through the examination of non-smart jewelry. We also demonstrate
three reimplementations and design concepts implemented with Snowflakes. Our exploration
with Snowflakes contributes to the wearable community in terms of smart-jewelry visual
expressions, interaction modalities, and merger of traditional and computational materials.},

based on their smartphone activity. These statuses were also presented to their IM
contacts in three different styles. Over a two-week period, the participants rarely
chose the status interruptible, and when they did, it was usually to indicate low
availability. Textual presentation was usually chosen to express statuses precisely,
especially at high and low extremes of receptivity; while graphical and numeric presentations
were preferred when self-perceived receptivity levels were more ambiguous. Conflicts
between recipients’ and senders’ perspectives are also discussed.},

of photos, notes, and bookmarks. Based on this survey we built Scraps, which consists
of two parts: 1) a mobile app that makes it easy for people to capture and add context

that information to a document on their desktop. In a field study with 11 information

control) and relational closeness to audience separately and interactively predict
the depth of distress disclosure, which in turn affects satisfaction with disclosure.

with an idol member for several seconds were regarded as its essential component until
the spread of COVID-19. Now, idol groups are struggling in the transition of such
events to computer-mediated communication because these events had emphasized meeting
face-to-face over communicating, as we can infer from their length of time. I anticipated
that investigating this emerging transition would provide implications because their
communication has a unique characteristic that is distinct from well-studied situations,
such as workplace communication and intimate relationships. Therefore, I first conducted
a quantitative survey to develop a precise understanding of the transition, and based
on its results, had semi-structured interviews with idol fans about their perceptions
of the transition. The survey revealed distinctive approaches, including one where
fans gathered at a venue but were isolated from the idol member by an acrylic plate
and talked via a video call. Then the interviews not only provided answers to why
such an approach would be reasonable but also suggested the existence of a large gap
between conventional offline events and emerging online events in their perceptions.
Based on the results, I discussed how we can develop interaction techniques to support
this transition and how we can apply it to other situations outside idol culture,
such as computer-mediated performing arts.},

abstract = { With the rise of COVID-19 cases globally, many countries released digital tools to
mitigate the effects of the pandemic. In Germany the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) published
the Corona-Data-Donation-App, a virtual citizen science (VCS) project, to establish
an early warning system for the prediction of potential COVID-19 hotspots using data
from wearable devices. While work on motivation for VCS projects in HCI often presents
egoistic motives as prevailing, there is little research on such motives in crises
situations. In this paper, we explore the socio-psychological processes and motivations
to share personal data during a pandemic. Our findings indicate that collective motives
dominated among app reviews (n=464) and in in-depth interviews (n=10). We contribute
implications for future VCS tools in times of crises that highlight the importance
of communication, transparency and responsibility.},

We then designed SansTouch, a multi-modal hand sleeve used together along with a smartphone
to enable mediated hand-to-hand interactions such as handshakes or holding hands.
To invoke the mediated touch, users synchronously mimic the hand position as in real
life while holding SansTouch. Users can feel the touch sensation in real time without
touching. Participants from our observational study (N=12) quickly adopted the hand-to-hand
interactions of SansTouch for exchanging greetings face-to-face with colleagues and
reported stronger preferences towards using SansTouch as opposed to mid-air gestures
(e.g., waving). We discuss design implications, including the trade-offs of multi-modality
for touch devices in face-to-face communication.},

their own health problems, and face tremendous stress with little support–all exacerbated

the lenses of health equity and community health can shape future technology design.
Through a 1.5 year long, in-depth research process with dementia community health
workers, we learned how caregiving support technology can reflect key concepts in
dementia community health practice. This paper makes two contributions: 1) We propose
employing embodied cueing, such as imitation or action mimicry, as a communication
modality that can align technology with community caregiving approaches, promote agency
in people with dementia, and relieve caregiver burden, and 2) We suggest new avenues
for HCI research to advance health equity in the context of dementia technology design.},

We identify ways in which DSTs need to engage with the healthcare sociotechnical system,

alternatives quickly, without added cost or risk of hardware faults. However, it is
challenging to use simulation as an aid during interactive debugging of physical circuits,
due to difficulties in comparing simulated analyses with hardware measurements. Designers
must continually configure simulations to match the state of the physical circuit
(e.g. capturing sensor inputs), and must manually rework the hardware to replicate
changes or analyses performed in simulation. We propose techniques leveraging instrumentation
and programmable test hardware to create a tight coupling between a physical circuit
and its simulated model. Bridging these representations helps designers to compare
simulated and measured behaviors, and to quickly perform analytical techniques on
hardware (e.g. parameter-response analysis) that are typically cumbersome outside
of simulation. We implement these techniques in a prototype and show how it aids in
efficiently debugging a variety of analog circuits. },

of sensing and interactive textiles is in increasing demand. Recently, advances in
digital machine knitting offer opportunities for the programmable, rapid fabrication
of soft, breathable textiles. In this paper, we present KnitUI, a novel, accessible
machine-knitted user interface based on resistive pressure sensing. Employing conductive
yarns and various machine knitting techniques, we computationally design and automatically
fabricate the double-layered resistive sensing structures as well as the coupled conductive
connection traces with minimal manual post-processing. We present an interactive design
interface for users to customize KnitUI’s colors, sizes, positions, and shapes. After
investigating design parameters for the optimized sensing and interactive performance,
we demonstrate KnitUI as a portable, deformable, washable, and customizable interactive
and sensing platform. It obtains diverse applications, including wearable user interfaces,
tactile sensing wearables, and artificial robot skin.},

boards that can withstand high current applications through copper electroplating.
To illustrate the capability of the TCB, we showcase a range of examples with various
shapes, electrical characteristics and interaction mechanisms. We also demonstrate
a new design tool extension to an existing CAD environment that allows users to parametrically
draw the substrate and conductive trace, and export 3D printable files. TCB is an
inexpensive and highly accessible fabrication technique intended to broaden HCI researcher

of technical experiments, we investigated TF-Cells’ thermoformability, depending on
their structure’s parameters, orientations, and heating conditions. Next, we present
a series of compound cells consisting of TF-Cells and solid structure to adjust stiffness
or reduce undesirable shape deformation. Adapting the results from the experiments,
we built a simple tool for embedding TF-Cells into a 3D model. Using the tool, we
implemented examples under contexts of mechanical fitting, ergonomic fitting, and

Assembler3 was able to reconstruct 100 of 105 models. Once 3D-reconstructed, we expect
users to store and share their models in 3D, which can simplify collaboration and
thereby empower the laser cutting community to create models of higher complexity.},

Our structures are best described as ruffled strips of thin sheet material, such as

stiffness directions and local density. Our computational design tool assists users
by automatically optimizing the ruffle to fill the shape’s volume, and exporting the
flat ruffle design ready for cutting. We demonstrate how such ruffled metamaterials

post-practice self-evaluation, and (iv) adjustable pause-handles for self-paced practice.
We base CAST on a formative user study (N=15) that provides fresh empirical grounds
on the needs and challenges of shadowers. We validate our design through a summative

privacy are increasing. To better understand how young children conceptualize data
processing and digital privacy risks, we interviewed 26 children, 4 to 10 years old,
from families with higher educational attainment recruited in a college town. Our
child participants construed apps’ and services’ data collection and storage practices
in terms of their benefits, both to themselves and for user safety, and characterized
both data tracking and privacy violations as interpersonal rather than considering
automated processes or companies as privacy threats. We identify four factors shaping
these mental models and privacy risk perceptions: (1) surface-level visual cues, (2)
past digital interactions involving data collection, (3) age and cognitive development,
and (4) privacy-related experiences in non-digital contexts. We discuss our findings’
design, educational, and public policy implications toward better supporting children
in identifying and reasoning about digital privacy risks.},

conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 Canadian elementary school teachers to
understand the risks teachers witness children aged 10–13 facing on digital media,
teachers’ mitigation strategies, and how prepared teachers are to help children. Our
results show that teachers regularly help children deal with digital risks outside
of teaching official curriculum, ranging from minor privacy violations to severe cases
of cyberbullying. Most issues reported by teachers were the result of typical behaviours
which became risky because they took place over digital media. We use the results

password with twelve lowercase letters (56-bit entropy) to generate the training interface.
It first leverages users’ spatial and visual (declarative) memory by showing them
a video clip based on the method of loci, and then consolidates the learning process
by having them play a computer game that leverages their motor (procedural) memory.
The results of a memorability study with 300 participants showed that LociMotion had
a significantly higher recall success rate than a control condition. A second study
with 200 participants demonstrated the effectiveness of LociMotion over a period of
time (99%, 96%, and 81% recall success rates after 1, 4, and 18 days, respectively).
LociMotion offers an alternative to the spaced repetition technique, as it does not
require dozens of training sessions. },

physical security on smartphones. It relies on behavioral traits (e.g., gait patterns)
for user identification, instead of biometric data or knowledge of a PIN. However,
it is not yet known whether users can understand the semantics of this technology
well enough to use it properly. We bridge this knowledge gap by evaluating how Android’s
Smart Lock (SL), which is the first widely deployed IA solution on smartphones, is
understood by its users. We conducted a qualitative user study (N=26) and an online
survey (N=331). The results suggest that users often have difficulty understanding
SL semantics, leaving them unable to judge when their phone would be (un)locked. We
found that various aspects of SL, such as its capabilities and its authentication
factors, are confusing for the users. We also found that depth of smartphone adoption
is a significant antecedent of SL comprehension.},

samples. This paper contributes quantitative results from a survey of 395 crypto-asset

for heterogeneity with a new typology that partitions the sample in three robust clusters
– cypherpunks, hodlers, and rookies – using five psychometric constructs. The constructs
originate from established behavioral theories with items purposefully adapted to
the domain. We demonstrate the utility of this typology in better understanding users’
characteristics and security behaviors. These insights inform the design of crypto-asset

management support, communication among stakeholders, and documentation and guidelines.

Users rarely perform these key authentication ceremonies, which makes their end-to-end
encrypted communication vulnerable. Our approach includes collaborative design workshops,
an expert evaluation, iterative storyboard prototyping, and an online evaluation.
While we could not demonstrate that our design approach resulted in improved usability
or user experience, we found that user-centered prototypes can increase the users’
comprehension of security implications. Hence, prototypes based on users’ intuitions,
needs, and values are useful starting points for approaching long-standing security
challenges. Applying complementary design approaches may improve usability and user

the root causes of a car’s malfunctioning. Drivers may need additional information
to assess these ambiguous situations correctly. However, it is yet unclear which information
is relevant and helpful to drivers in such situations. Hence, we conducted a mixed-methods
online survey (N = 60) on Amazon MTurk where we exposed participants to two security-
and safety-critical situations with one of three different explanations. We applied
Thematic and Correspondence Analysis to understand which factors in these situations
moderate drivers’ information demand. We identified a fundamental information demand
across scenarios that is expanded by error-specific information types. Moreover, we
found that it is necessary to communicate error sources, since drivers might not be
able to identify them correctly otherwise. Thereby, malicious intrusions are typically
perceived as more critical than technical malfunctions. },

abstract = {In this paper, we describe and analyze a workshop developed for a work training program
called DataWorks. In this workshop, data workers chose a topic of their interest,
sourced and processed data on that topic, and used that data to create presentations.
Drawing from discourses of data literacy; epistemic agency and lived experience; and
critical race theory, we analyze the workshops’ activities and outcomes. Through this
analysis, three themes emerge: the tensions between epistemic agency and the context
of work, encountering the ordinariness of racism through data work, and understanding
the personal as communal and intersectional. Finally, critical race theory also prompts
us to consider the very notions of data literacy that undergird our workshop activities.
From this analysis, we offer a series of suggestions for approaching designing data
literacy activities, taking into account critical race theory.},

we tested whether the perceived identity (i.e., whether a partner was believed to
be a bot or as a human) or conversational style (human or robotic) of a teammate would
moderate the outcomes of participants’ creative production. In Study 1, participants
worked with either a chatbot or a human confederate. In Study 2, all participants
worked with a human teammate but were informed that their partner was either a human
or a chatbot. Conversely, all participants worked with a chatbot in Study 3, but their
partner was described as either a chatbot or a human. We investigated differences
in idea generation outcomes and found that participants consistently contributed more
ideas and ideas of higher quality when they perceived their teamworking partner to
be a bot. Furthermore, when the conversational style of the partner was robotic, participants
with high anxiety in group communication reported greater creative self-efficacy in
task performance. Finally, whether the perceived dominance of a partner and the pressure
to come up with ideas during the task mediated positive outcomes of idea generation
depended on whether the conversational style of the bot partner was robot- or human-like.
Based on our findings, we discussed implications for future design of artificial agents

interpretation errors can affect users’ task performance, but little is known about

learning, so frequent interpretation errors may increase attention and learning; alternatively,
however, interpretation errors may negatively interfere with skill development. To
explore these potentially important effects, we conducted studies where participants
learned commands with various rates of artificially injected interpretation errors.
Our results showed that higher rates of interpretation error led to worse memory retention,
higher completion times, higher occurrences of user error (beyond those injected by
the system), and greater perceived effort. These findings indicate that when input
mechanisms must interpret the user’s input, interpretation errors cause problems for

recognize five drone emotional expressions, as well as make sense of intensities within

As a consequence, we formulate design recommendations for social drones and discuss

signals both recognition of a problem and typically enlists sympathy and assistance
to resolve it. This could enhance robot acceptability and provides an opportunity
for interactive learning. Using a speculative design approach we explore how, when

probes, scenario development and low-fidelity prototyping exercises suggest that:
embarrassment is relevant for managing a diverse range of social scenarios, impacts
on both humanoid and non-humanoid robot design, and highlights the critical importance
of understanding interactional context. We conclude that embarrassment is fundamental

abstract = { Participants in text entry studies usually copy phrases or compose novel messages.
A composition task mimics actual user behavior and can allow researchers to better
understand how a system might perform in reality. A problem with composition is that
participants may gravitate towards writing simple text, that is, text containing only
common words. Such simple text is insufficient to explore all factors governing a
text entry method, such as its error correction features. We contribute to enhancing
composition tasks in two ways. First, we show participants can modulate the difficulty
of their compositions based on simple instructions. While it took more time to compose
difficult messages, they were longer, had more difficult words, and resulted in more
use of error correction features. Second, we compare two methods for obtaining a participant’s
intended text, comparing both methods with a previously proposed crowdsourced judging
procedure. We found participant-supplied references were more accurate.},

queries because they lack domain-specific language and well-defined informational
goals. Perhaps search tools rely too much on the query to understand what a searcher
wants. Towards expanding this contextual understanding of a user during exploratory
search, we introduce a novel system, CoNotate, which offers query suggestions based
on analyzing the searcher’s notes and previous searches for patterns and gaps in information.
To evaluate this approach, we conducted a within-subjects study where participants
(n=38) conducted exploratory searches using a baseline system (standard web search)
and the CoNotate system. The CoNotate approach helped searchers issue significantly
more queries, and discover more terminology than standard web search. This work demonstrates
how search can leverage user-generated content to help people get started when exploring
complex, multi-faceted information spaces. },

generalized the classical statistical decoding algorithm to correct insertion, substitution

results confirmed that the proposed algorithm outperformed baseline techniques: users
reached 22.8 WPM typing speed with a significantly lower error rate and higher user-perceived

mixed reality (MR) environments by pressing against the user's fingerpad when a user

when the user interacts with real-world objects. Its design allows it to fold back
on top of the user's nail when not in use, keeping the user's fingerpad free to, for
instance, manipulate handheld tools and other objects while in MR. To achieve this,
we engineered a wireless and self-contained haptic device, which measures 24\texttimes{}24\texttimes{}41&nbsp;mm
and weighs 9.5&nbsp;g. Furthermore, our foldable end-effector also features a linear resonant
actuator, allowing it to render not only touch contacts (i.e., pressure) but also
textures (i.e., vibrations). We demonstrate how our device renders contacts with MR
surfaces, buttons, low- and high-frequency textures. In our first user study, we found
that participants perceived our device to be more realistic than a previous haptic
device that also leaves the fingerpad free (i.e., fingernail vibration). In our second
user study, we investigated the participants’ experience while using our device in
a real-world task that involved physical objects. We found that our device allowed
participants to use the same finger to manipulate handheld tools, small objects, and
even feel textures and liquids, without much hindrance to their dexterity, while feeling
haptic feedback when touching MR interfaces.},

abstract = {Using microgestures, prior work has successfully enabled gestural interactions while
holding objects. Yet, these existing methods are prone to false activations caused
by natural finger movements while holding or manipulating the object. We address this
issue with SoloFinger, a novel concept that allows design of microgestures that are
robust against movements that naturally occur during primary activities. Using a data-driven
approach, we establish that single-finger movements are rare in everyday hand-object
actions and infer a single-finger input technique resilient to false activation. We
demonstrate this concept’s robustness using a white-box classifier on a pre-existing
dataset comprising 36 everyday hand-object actions. Our findings validate that simple
SoloFinger gestures can relieve the need for complex finger configurations or delimiting
gestures and that SoloFinger is applicable to diverse hand-object actions. Finally,
we demonstrate SoloFinger’s high performance on commodity hardware using random forest
classifiers. },

abstract = {Inefficient menu interfaces lead to system and application commands being tedious
to execute in Immersive Environments. HoloBar is a novel approach to ease the interaction
with multi-level menus in immersive environments: with HoloBar, the hierarchical menu
splits between the field of view (FoV) of the Head Mounted Display and the smartphone
(SP). Command execution is based on around-the-FoV interaction with the SP, and touch
input on the SP display. The HoloBar offers a unique combination of features, namely
rapid mid-air activation, implicit selection of top-level items and preview of second-level
items on the SP, ensuring rapid access to commands. In a first study we validate its
activation method, which consists in bringing the SP within an activation distance
from the FoV. In a second study, we compare the HoloBar to two alternatives, including
the standard HoloLens menu. Results show that the HoloBar shortens each step of a
multi-level menu interaction (menu activation, top-level item selection, second-level
item selection and validation), with a high success rate. A follow-up study confirms
that these results remain valid when compared with the two validation mechanisms of
HoloLens (Air-Tap and clicker).},

abstract = { Learning a musical instrument requires regular exercise. However, students are often
on their own during their practice sessions due to the limited time with their teachers,
which increases the likelihood of mislearning playing techniques. To address this
issue, we present Let’s Frets - a modular guitar learning system that provides visual
indicators and capturing of finger positions on a 3D-printed capacitive guitar fretboard.
We based the design of Let’s Frets on requirements collected through in-depth interviews
with professional guitarists and teachers. In a user study (N=24), we evaluated the
feedback modules of Let’s Frets against fretboard charts. Our results show that visual
indicators require the least time to realize new finger positions while a combination
of visual indicators and position capturing yielded the highest playing accuracy.
We conclude how Let’s Frets enables independent practice sessions that can be translated
to other musical instruments.},
