abstract = {Recent rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) with unlimited participants, makes
employing learning tools such as interactive simulations all but inevitable. Interactive
simulations give students the opportunity to experiment with concrete examples and
develop better understanding of concepts they have learned. However, some students
do not learn well from this relatively unstructured form of interaction, suggesting
the provision of adaptive support as a way to address this issue. This paper presents
a formal evaluation of providing support to facilitate open exploration. We describe
the process of designing an intervention delivery mechanism for adding adaptive support
to an exploratory interactive simulation. The experimental evaluation of the adaptive
version of the simulation indicates that the adaptive support provided to students
significantly improved their learning performance. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
of users' acceptance of the system are generally positive but pinpoint areas for improvement.},

and education, but access barriers exist due to training, costs, safety, logistics,
and spatial separation. High-throughput equipment combined with web streaming could
enable interactive biology experiments online, but no such platform currently exists.
We present a cloud experimentation architecture (paralleling cloud computation), which
is optimized for a class of domain-specific equipments (biotic processing units -
BPU) to share and execute many experiments in parallel remotely and interactively
at all time. We implemented an instance of this architecture that enables chemotactic
experiments with a slime mold Physarum Polycephelum. A user study in the blended teaching
and research setting of a graduate-level biophysics class demonstrated that this platform
lowers the access barrier for non-biologists, enables discovery, and facilitates learning
analytics. This architecture is flexible for integration with various biological specimens
and equipments to facilitate scalable interactive online education, collaborations,
research, and citizen science.},

We present an augmented version of instant messaging, WaitChatter, that supports the
notion of wait-learning by displaying contextually relevant foreign language vocabulary
and micro-quizzes just-in-time while the user awaits a response from her conversant.
Through a two week field study of WaitChatter with 20 people, we found that users
were able to learn 57 new words on average during casual instant messaging. Furthermore,
we found that users were most receptive to learning opportunities immediately after
sending a chat message, and that this timing may be critical given user tendency to
multi-task during waiting periods.},

abstract = {Most user interfaces require the user to focus on one element at a time, but StarCraft
2 is a game where players often control more than a hundred units simultaneously.
The game interface provides an optional mechanism called "control groups" that allows
players to select multiple units and assign them to a group in order to quickly recall
previous selections of units. From an analysis of over 3,000 replays, we show that
the usage of control groups is a key differentiator of individual players as well
as players of different skill levels---novice users rarely use control groups while
experts nearly always do. But players also behave differently in how they use their
control groups, especially in time-pressured situations. While certain control group
behaviors are common across all skill levels, expert players appear to be better at
remaining composed and sustaining control group use in battle. We also qualitatively
analyze discussions on web forums from players about how they use control groups to
provide context about how such a simple interface mechanic has produced numerous ways
of optimizing unit control.},

videogame were controlled by other humans (avatars) or by the game (agents). The impact
on player experience was explored through both subjective questionnaire measures and
brain wave activity measurement (electroencephalography). Play with human teammates
was associated with a greater sense of relatedness, but less competence and flow than
play with other computer-controlled teammates. In terms of brain activity, play with
human teammates was associated with greater activity in the alpha, theta and beta
power bands than play with computer-controlled teammates. Overall, the results suggest
that play with human teammates involves greater cognitive activity in terms of 'mentalising'
than play with computer-controlled teammates. Additionally, the associations between
subjective measures of player experience and brain activity are described. Limitations
of the current study are identified and key directions for future research are discussed.},

the computer club enables the emergence of social ties among residents of the camp
and university students acting as tutors. Even though the ties are small-scale and
informal, they have the potential to generate new and wider opportunities for exchange
that may eventually support more social integration between the camp's marginalized
population and the wider Palestinian population.},

of a CI factor across three different studies despite broad differences in (a) communication
media (face-to-face vs online), (b) group contexts (short-term ad hoc groups vs long-term
groups) and (c) cultural settings (US, Germany, and Japan). In two of the studies,
we also show that CI is correlated with a group's performance on more complex tasks.
Consequently, the CI metric provides a generalizable performance measure for groups
that is robust to broad changes in media, context, and culture, making it useful for
testing the effects of general-purpose collaboration technologies intended to improve
group performance.},

How about in OSS? Using GitHub, the largest publicly available collection of OSS projects,
we studied how gender and tenure diversity relate to team productivity and turnover.
Using regression modeling of GitHub data and the results of a survey, we show that
both gender and tenure diversity are positive and significant predictors of productivity,
together explaining a sizable fraction of the data variability. These results can
inform decision making on all levels, leading to better outcomes in recruiting and

safety, but these settings are often opaque and poorly understood. To understand the
complex relationship between identity, personal style and online self-representation,
we examine how people explore and experiment with new styles in public and in private
online settings during gender transition. We present the results of interviews with
transgender people who have recently reinvented their personal style, or are planning
to do so in the near future. We find that people explore new styles in online settings
to craft possible or ideal future selves. When involving others, people engage intimate
and unknown others, but often avoid weak ties. Our results indicate that to account
for changing identities, social media sites must be designed to support finding inspiration
and advice from strangers and style experimentation with close friends.},

abstract = {Information environments have the power to affect people's perceptions and behaviors.
In this paper, we present the results of studies in which we characterize the gender
bias present in image search results for a variety of occupations. We experimentally
evaluate the effects of bias in image search results on the images people choose to
represent those careers and on people's perceptions of the prevalence of men and women
in each occupation. We find evidence for both stereotype exaggeration and systematic
underrepresentation of women in search results. We also find that people rate search
results higher when they are consistent with stereotypes for a career, and shifting
the representation of gender in image search results can shift people's perceptions
about real-world distributions. We also discuss tensions between desires for high-quality
results and broader societal goals for equality of representation in this space.},

abstract = {Automated coaching systems offer a convenient, cost-effective way to reduce stress,
which can be a serious health issue. However, one concern with such systems is compliance;
users fail to achieve daily stress reduction goals because goals are too easy or too
difficult. To address this, we built DStress (Design for Stress), a theoretically
grounded system that sets adaptive goals in three coaching dimensions: Exercise, Meditation
and Accessibility. DStress modifies goal-difficulty based on the individual's immediately
previous performance. In a 28-day deployment with 65 users, DStress reduced scores
on one direct measure of stress almost in half, significantly more than two other
non-adaptive coaching strategies. However, on a second direct stress measure, no improvement
was found. There were also no improvements on other indirect stress measures. Analysis
of 2842 user-generated reports suggests our findings were the result of DStress balancing
compliance against the degree of challenge of the goals it would set.},

in a real-life 12-week user study involving 27 clinical patients. The quantitative
and qualitative results revealed that SoberDiary helped patients self-monitor and
-manage their alcohol-use behavior, and reduced their total alcohol consumption as
well as the number of heavy drinking days. Compared with patients who received standard
treatment alone, this study demonstrated SoberDiary successfully complemented current
alcohol treatment in reducing patients' alcoholic cravings and dropout rate over 3-month
study period. Follow-up interviews further revealed the sophisticated use practices
and value of SoberDiary.},

explicitly foregrounds play, irony and the limitations of technological intervention.
Three of the game concepts are presented as design fictions in the form of advertisements
for products and services that do not exist. The paper argues that design fiction
can help create a space for design beyond solutionism.},

In order to provide a transportable system that works in areas where there are no
ceilings, we provide an integrated unit (1.3m height) that stands on the floor. One
unsolved challenge for laser projectors is to cover large projection areas while providing
high resolution at the same time. Our focus + context laser projector solves this
problem. BaseLase can cover a large context area in low resolution, while providing
three movable high-resolution focus spots. We provide a convex mirror design that
enables the laser to reach a large area (75m2) with low resolution while decreasing
the beam divergence compared to spherical or parabolic mirrors. This hyperboloidal
mirror shape approximately equalizes the point size on the floor independent from
the projected location. We propose to add a number of planar mirrors on pan-tilt units
to create dynamic zones of high resolution that can adjust to the user behavior. We
provide example applications for BaseLase and report on user experience in preliminary
trials.},

that scales to arbitrary size, therefore allowing direct touch to scale to very large
numbers of display objects. In this paper, however, we argue that the price for this
benefit is bad physical ergonomics: prolonged standing, especially in combination
with looking down, quickly causes fatigue and repetitive strain. We propose addressing
this issue by allowing users to operate touch floors in any pose they like, including
sitting and lying. To allow users to transition between poses seamlessly, we present
a simple pose-aware view manager that supports users by adjusting the entire view
to the new pose. We support the main assumption behind the work with a simple study
that shows that several poses are indeed more ergonomic for touch floor interaction
than standing. We ground the design of our view manager by analyzing, which screen
regions users can see and touch in each of the respective poses.},

from 4 focus groups (N=17). The results show that 71% of the elicited gestures were
spatially-aware and that participants strongly associated cross-device tasks with
interacting and thinking in space. In phase 2, we implemented one spatially-agnostic
and two spatially-aware techniques from phase 1 and compared them in a controlled
experiment (N=12). The results indicate that spatially-aware techniques are preferred
by users and can decrease mental demand, effort, and frustration, but only when they
are designed with great care. We conclude with a summary of findings to inform the
design of future cross-device interactions.},

design that first considers the affordances of sounds in order to imagine embodied
interaction, and based on this, generates interaction models for interaction designers
wishing to work with sound. We describe a series of workshops, called Form Follows
Sound, where participants ideate imagined sonic interactions, and then realize working
interactive sound prototypes. We introduce the Sonic Incident technique, as a way
to recall memorable sound experiences. We identified three interaction models for
sonic interaction design: conducting; manipulating; substituting. These three interaction
models offer interaction designers and developers a framework on which they can build
richer sonic interactions.},

explore how it could be repurposed as user input. We analyse ten days of recorded
audio from our participants, alongside corresponding interviews, to explore how systems
might make use of extracts from this stream. Rather than containing directly actionable
items, our data suggests that the continuous speech stream is a rich resource for
identifying users' next actions, along with the interests and dispositions of those
being recorded. Through design workshops we explored new interactions using the speech
stream, and describe concepts for individual, shared and distributed use.},

abstract = {While the technology underlying speech interfaces has improved in recent years, our
understanding of the human side of speech interactions remains limited. This paper
provides new insight on one important human aspect of speech interactions: the sense
of agency - defined as the experience of controlling one's own actions and their outcomes.
Two experiments are described. In each case a voice command is compared with keyboard
input. Agency is measured using an implicit metric: intentional binding. In both experiments
we find that participants' sense of agency is significantly reduced for voice commands
as compared to keyboard input. This finding presents a fundamental challenge for the
design of effective speech interfaces. We reflect on this finding and, based on current
theory in HCI and cognitive neuroscience, offer possible explanations for the reduced
sense of agency observed in speech interfaces.},

without any semantic association to the signified event, and language-based warnings
are examples of such displays. This paper presents a first comparison between these
two types, across all combinations of audio, visual and tactile modalities. Speech,
text and Speech Tactons (a novel form of tactile warnings synchronous to speech) were
compared to abstract pulses in two experiments. Results showed that recognition times
of warning urgency during a non-critical driving situation were shorter for abstract
warnings, highly urgent warnings and warnings including visual feedback. Response
times during a critical situation were shorter for warnings including audio. We therefore
suggest abstract visual feedback when informing drivers during a non-critical situation
and audio in a highly critical one. Language-based warnings during a critical situation
performed equally well as abstract ones, so they are suggested as less annoying vehicle
alerts.},

in email during both short and long sessions. Our analysis suggests two primary factors
in getting lost: the number of emails awaiting a reply and whether or not the session
caused an interruption. We conclude that much of the problem around getting lost in
email is in managing the tension between promptly responding to messages while limiting
engagement with email.},

negative outcomes including lower work and life satisfaction and increased stress.
Previous work has suggested that in order to reduce some of these negative effects,
people should adopt technology use strategies that aid separation of their home and
work lives. In this paper we report the results of a questionnaire study investigating
work-life balance boundary behaviours and technology use. We find that people use
multiple devices as a way of creating boundaries between home and work, and the extent
to which they do this relates to their boundary behaviour style. These findings have
particular relevance given the increasing trend for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies.},

media. Recent work in CHI and CSCW has applied linguistic analysis towards understanding
employee experiences. In this paper, we apply dictionary based linguistic analysis
to measure 'Employee Engagement'. Employee engagement is a measure of employee willingness
to apply discretionary effort towards organizational goals, and plays an important
role in organizational outcomes such as financial or operational results. Organizations
typically use surveys to measure engagement. This paper describes an approach to model
employee engagement based on word choice in social media. This method can potentially
complement surveys, thus providing more real-time insights into engagement and allowing
organizations to address engagement issues faster. Our results predicting engagement
scores on a survey by combining demographics with social media text demonstrate that
social media text has significant predictive power compared to demographic data alone.
We also find that engagement may be a state than a stable trait since social media
posts closer to the administration of the survey had the most predictive power. We
further identify the minimum number of social media posts required per employee for
the best prediction.},

a broader spectrum of 28 lists. We report how members of the different communities

mailing lists to other group communication tools. But we also identify several tensions

Some service providers resort to using heavy-weight identification mechanisms, judging

an unwarranted privacy invasion in this context, if carried out merely to perform
adulthood estimation. This paper presents a mechanism that exploits the adult's more
extensive exposure to public media, relying on the likelihood that they will be able
to recall details if cued by a carefully chosen picture. We conducted an online study
to gauge the viability of this scheme. With our prototype we were able to predict
that the user was a child 99% of the time. Unfortunately the scheme also misclassified
too many adults. We discuss our results and suggest directions for future research.},

showing a higher sense of self-representation. We demonstrate the application of our

this technique with an instantiation on Twitter to pair people who are different from
each other in airports. Even though there were many missed meetings, 53% of survey
respondents would be interested in being matched again, and eight people even met
in person. Through piggyback prototyping, we gained insight into the future design
of this system. We conclude the paper with considerations for privacy, consent, volume

enables unskilled workers with limited commitment to work together to complete tasks

We find that breaking these tasks into microtasks results in longer overall task completion
times, but higher quality outcomes and a better experience that may be more resilient

we present a case study of the largest single platform of citizen driven data analysis
projects to date, the Zooniverse. By eliciting, through structured reflection, experiences
of core members of its design team, our grounded analysis yielded four sets of themes,
focusing on Task Specificity, Community Development, Task Design and Public Relations
and Engagement, supported by two-to-four specific design claims each. For each, we
propose a set of design claims (DCs), drawing comparisons to the literature on crowdsourcing
and online communities to contextualise our findings.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of mobile devices has resulted in more opportunities to interact with
more people than ever before. Given a finite capacity for interaction with others,
people commonly manage their availability by limiting others' access to them. Prior
work has demonstrated the importance of doing so in a relationally sensitive way and
identified the butler lie, in which deception is used to manage availability, as a
common linguistic strategy. Two key limitations of existing exploratory work, however,
are limited samples of primarily students and a focus on media properties in understanding
ambiguity that enables butler lies to be plausible. This paper aims to address these
issues via a broad field study of deception and butler lies using a novel message-sampling
method employed via a custom mobile app. Results show clear evidence of butler lies
occurring in a broader population, with some gender differences; and urge adoption
of a multi-level framework for understanding ambiguity that also includes private
information and infrastructure-level attributes of interaction media.},

Philippines have shown how citizens can organize themselves and coordinate private
relief activities. These activities can be found in (physical) groups of affected
people, but also within (digital) social media communities. There is an evident need,
however, for a clearer picture of what exactly is going on to be available for use
by the official emergency services: to enlist them, to keep them safe, to support
their efforts and to avoid needless duplications or conflicts. Aligning emergency
services and volunteer activities is, then, crucial. In this paper we present a mobile
crowd sensing based concept, which was designed as well as implemented as the application
CrowdMonitor and facilitates the detection of physical and digital activities and
the assignment of specific tasks to citizens. Finally we outline the findings of its
evaluation.},

were conducted with "digital volunteers" such as Facebook moderators of disaster-related
groups. Based on the challenges identified, we designed and implemented the cross-social-media
application "XHELP", which allows information to be both, acquired and distributed
cross-media and cross-channel. The evaluation with 20 users leads to further design
requirements for applications aiming to support volunteer moderators during disasters.},

has received considerable interest from several domains over the last two decades.
A concept that is easily and widely applicable, it has evolved a variety of nuanced
interpretations. Recent work in the systems theory and resilience engineering domains
has moved towards some sharper definitions. This paper discusses and develops these
definitions, and by contrasting with robustness, applies them as an approach for HCI
evaluation. Ethnographic data from a hospital training environment is used to examine
how patients learn to operate home haemodialysis devices, and how patients' safety
is managed and maintained. This paper concludes that to improve recovery of adverse
situations within the home, there is a necessity for design to support the acquirement
of resilient reaction as a skill, in hand with temporal management. These ideas are
developed in conjunction with the consideration of how technology can support, or
nudge, the expression of resilient behaviours.},

Our mixed-methods approach provides three key advantages for health design science
in HCI: (1) it provides a structured health sciences theoretical framework to guide

statistical patterns of polarizing and consensus views; and (3) it empowers participants
to actively weigh competing values that are most personally significant to them.},

Results suggest that the ability to move does not increase performance, and that a

or no physical navigation (i.e., moving their bodies). To isolate the effects of physical
and virtual navigation, a second experiment compared conditions where participants
could navigate using either only physical movement or only virtual navigation. The
second experiment showed that physical movement does benefit performance. The results
from the experiments suggest that moving may not be improving performance, depending
on the use of virtual navigation.},

abstract = {Clutching is usually assumed to be triggered by a lack of physical space and detrimental
to pointing performance. We conduct a controlled experiment using a laptop trackpad
where the effect of clutching on pointing performance is dissociated from the effects
of control-to-display transfer functions. Participants performed a series of target
acquisition tasks using typical cursor acceleration functions with and without clutching.
All pointing tasks were feasible without clutching, but clutch-less movements were
harder to perform, caused more errors, required more preparation time, and were not
faster than clutch-enabled movements.},

abstract = {Menu interfaces often arrange options into semantic groups. This semantic structure
is then usually conveyed to the user by supplementary visual grouping cues. We investigate
whether these visual grouping cues actually help users locate items in menus faster,
and whether there is potential for these powerful grouping cues to impede search when
used inappropriately. Thirty-six participants performed known-item searches of word
menus. These menus differed along three dimensions: (1) whether visual grouping cues
were used, (2) whether items were semantically organized, and (3) the number of items
belonging to each semantic group. Results show that the usefulness of visual grouping
entirely depends on the underlying semantic structure of the menu. When menus were
semantically organized, having visual grouping cues delineate the boundaries between
large semantic groups resulted in the fastest search times. But when semantically
unrelated items were visually grouped together, participants took far longer to locate
targets. Menu designers should therefore take great care to avoid visually grouping
semantically unrelated items as this has the potential to hinder menu interactions.},

abstract = {Although ubiquitous, color pickers have remained largely unchanged for 25 years. Based
on contextual interviews with artists and designers, we created the Color Portraits
design space to characterize five key color manipulation activities: sampling and
tweaking individual colors, manipulating color relationships, combining colors with
other elements, revisiting previous color choices, and revealing a design process
through color. We found similar color manipulation requirements with scientists and
engineers. We designed novel color interaction tools inspired by the design space,
and used them as probes to identify specific design requirements, including: interactive
palettes for sampling colors and exploring relationships; color composites for blending
and decomposing colors with other elements; interactive histories to enable reuse
of previous color choices; and providing color as a way to reveal underlying processes.
We argue that color tools should allow users to interact with colors, not just pick
or sample them.},

abstract = {One reason that human interaction with technology is difficult to understand is because
the way in which people perform interactive tasks is highly adaptive. One such interactive
task is menu search. In the current article we test the hypothesis that menu search
is rationally adapted to (1) the ecological structure of interaction, (2) cognitive
and perceptual limits, and (3) the goal to maximise the trade-off between speed and
accuracy. Unlike in previous models, no assumptions are made about the strategies
available to or adopted by users, rather the menu search problem is specified as a
reinforcement learning problem and behaviour emerges by finding the optimal Markov
Decision Process (MDP). The model is tested against existing empirical findings concerning
the effect of menu organisation and menu length. The model predicts the effect of
these variables on task completion time and eye movements. The discussion considers
the pros and cons of the modelling approach relative to other well-known mod- elling
approaches.},

abstract = {Today's widely deployed painting applications use a linear undo model that allows
users to backtrack previous operations in reverse chronological order. This undo model
is not useful if the user has performed desired operations after undesired ones. Selective
undo, in contrast, allows users to select specific operations in the past and only
undo those, while keeping the remaining operations intact. Although selective undo
has been widely explored in the context of text editing and object-oriented drawing,
we explore selective undo for painting (bitmap) editing, which has received less attention
and introduces many interesting user interface design challenges. Our system, called
Aquamarine, explores the script model for selective undo, where selectively undone
operations are skipped in the history, rather than the more explored inverse model,
which puts an inverse of the selected operations at the end of the history. We discuss
the design implications and show through two informal user studies that selective
undo is usable and desirable},
