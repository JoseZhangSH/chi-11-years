on crisis and disaster management. New media enable citizens to rapidly self-organise
in emergent groups. Theoretical framing of their interactions with established organisations
is lacking. To address this, we conduct a thematic analysis on qualitative data from
the European migration crisis of 2015. We draw on context-rich material from both
emergent groups and established organisation. To represent our findings, we introduce
the notion of socio-technical dynamics. We derive implications for computer supported
cooperative work in crises and disasters. These insights contribute to the efficient
involvement of emergent groups in established systems.},

use of idiosyncratic constructs when judging the user experience of diverse products
and, on the other hand, the statistical methods available to analyze such data. The
paper more specifically proposed a method to extract diverse perspectives (called
views) from experimental data. The current paper provides three improvements of this
existing method by: 1) showing that a little-known approach for clustering attributes,
called VARCLUS, can be applied and extended to provide a more optimal algorithm, 2)
showing how the VARCLUS method can be applied to perform both within- and across-subject
analysis, and 3) providing access to the VARCLUS method by incorporating it in ILLMO,
a user-friendly and freely available program for interactive statistics.},

abstract = {Resistive force (e.g., due to object elasticity) and impact (e.g., due to recoil)
are common effects in our daily life. However, resistive force continuously changes
due to users' movements while impact instantly occurs when an event triggers it. These
feedback are still not realistically provided by current VR haptic methods. In this
paper, a wearable device, ElasticVR, which consists of an elastic band, servo motors
and mechanical brakes, is proposed to provide the continuously-changing resistive
force and instantly-occurring impact upon the user's hand to enhance VR realism. By
changing two physical properties, length and extension distance, of the elastic band,
ElasticVR provides multilevel resistive force with no delay and impact with little
delay, respectively, for realistic and versatile VR applications. A force perception
study was performed to observe users' force distinguishability of the resistive force
and impact, and the prototype was built based on its results. A VR experience study
further proves that the resistive force and impact from ElasticVR both outperform
those from current approaches in realism. Applications using ElasticVR are also demonstrated.},

may be unreliable or biased if the respondents do not fully understand or are not
willing to honestly answer the questions. To this end, we propose a framework for
objective personality detection that leverages humans' physiological responses to
external stimuli. We exemplify and evaluate the framework in a case study, where we
expose subjects to affective image and video stimuli, and capture their physiological
responses using a commercial-grade eye-tracking sensor. These responses are then processed
and fed into a classifier capable of accurately predicting a range of personality
traits. Our work yields notably high predictive accuracy, suggesting the applicability
of the proposed framework for robust personality detection.},

of senses are in use. We present a framework of meaning in interaction, based on a

attention-based Deep Neural Networks which not only support a prediction of which
words to highlight but also enable labelers to indicate words that should be assigned
a high attention weight while labeling to improve the future quality of word prediction.We
evaluated the labeling efficiency and the accuracy by comparing the conditions with

we argue that future translation environment research should focus more strongly on
these modalities in addition to mouse- and keyboard-based approaches. On the other
hand, eye tracking and gesture modalities seem less important. An additional interview
regarding interface design revealed that most translators would also see value in
automatically receiving additional resources when a high cognitive load is detected

Participants swam to a series of targets. Proficient swimmers preferred the discrete

discrete mode increased error. Based on the results, we contribute insights for designing

data-driven insights. While effective in lab settings, almost all DSTs have failed
in practice. Empirical research diagnosed poor contextual fit as the cause. This paper
describes the design and field evaluation of a radically new form of DST. It automatically
generates slides for clinicians' decision meetings with subtly embedded machine prognostics.
This design took inspiration from the notion of Unremarkable Computing, that by augmenting
the users' routines technology/AI can have significant importance for the users yet
remain unobtrusive. Our field evaluation suggests clinicians are more likely to encounter
and embrace such a DST. Drawing on their responses, we discuss the importance and
intricacies of finding the right level of unremarkableness in DST design, and share
lessons learned in prototyping critical AI systems as a situated experience.},

saw a mixed set of AI- and human-written profiles, they mistrusted hosts whose profiles
were labeled as or suspected to be written by AI. Our findings have implications for
the design of systems that involve AI technologies in online self-presentation and

A sheet-like touch interface is constructed from magnetic rubber sheets and conductive

can still detect the user's finger above the sheet because of the rubber's dielectric
nature. Furthermore, tactile feedback can be customized with ease by using our magnetizing
toolkit to change the magnetic patterns. Using the magnetizing toolkit, we investigated
the appropriate size and thickness of haptic interfaces and demonstrated several interfaces
such as buttons, sliders, switches, and dials. Our method is an easy and convenient
way to customize the size, shape, and haptic feedback of a wide variety of interfaces.},

was used. Participants attended two sessions with blinded stimulation and interacted
with a virtual ball using tracked hands in VR. The effects were studied using electroencephalography

confirm enhanced processing of the illusory touch after the stimulation, and some
of these changes were correlated to subjective rating of its magnitude.},

compared to using casual language in both paid and volunteer conditions, but does

formal language in studies containing complex tasks where fully reading instructions
is especially important. We also highlight trade-offs that different recruitment incentives

the resolution of the user's haptic perception increased. As changing haptic sensations

abstract = {MModern day voice-activated virtual assistants allow users to share and ask for information
that could be considered as personal through different input modalities and devices.
Using Google Assistant, this study examined if the differences in modality (i.e.,
voice vs. text) and device (i.e., smartphone vs. smart home device) affect user perceptions
when users attempt to retrieve sensitive health information from voice assistants.
Major findings from this study suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction significantly
enhanced perceived social presence of the voice assistant, but only when the users
solicited less sensitive health-related information. Furthermore, when individuals
reported less privacy concerns, voice (vs. text) interaction elicited positive attitudes
toward the voice assistant via increased social presence, but only in the low (vs.
high) information sensitivity condition. Contrary to modality, the device difference
did not exert any significant impact on the attitudes toward the voice assistant regardless
of the sensitivity level of the health information being asked or the level of individuals'
privacy concerns.},

HCI and design in PBD research and practice: utilizing values- and critically-oriented
design approaches to foreground social values and help define privacy problem spaces.
We argue such approaches, in addition to current "design to solve privacy problems"
efforts, are essential to the full realization of PBD, while noting the politics involved

transformed, creating dynamic representations. Whiteboxing is triggered during disconfirming
events when representations are discovered as problematic. Complementing existing

intentional squeezes from innocuous handling; and (4) an interaction design to promote

abstract = {This paper tracks a debate that occurred, first, within the field of Ubiquitous Computing
but quickly spread to CHI and beyond, in which design scholars argued that seamlessness
had long been an implicit and privileged design virtue, often at the expense of seamfulness.
Seamless design emphasizes clarity, simplicity, ease of use, and consistency to facilitate
technological interaction. Seamful design emphasizes configurability, user appropriation,
and revelation of complexity, ambiguity or inconsistency. Here we review these literatures
together and argue that, rather than rival approaches, seamful and seamless design
are complements, each emphasizing different aspects of downstream user agency. Ultimately,
we situate this debate within the larger, perennial discussion about the strategic
revelation and concealment of human and technological operations, and therein the
role of design.},

abilities to understand the relationship between a machine learning model's stated
performance on held-out data and its expected performance post deployment. We conduct
large-scale, randomized human-subject experiments to examine whether laypeople's trust
in a model, measured in terms of both the frequency with which they revise their predictions
to match those of the model and their self-reported levels of trust in the model,
varies depending on the model's stated accuracy on held-out data and on its observed
accuracy in practice. We find that people's trust in a model is affected by both its
stated accuracy and its observed accuracy, and that the effect of stated accuracy
can change depending on the observed accuracy. Our work relates to recent research
on interpretable machine learning, but moves beyond the typical focus on model internals,
exploring a different component of the machine learning pipeline.},

We begin this work by outlining existing scholarship describing how the consumption

Subsequently, we build on the social justice framework introduced by Dombrowski, Harmon,
and Fox to discuss how HCI may resist or counter such forces. We offer six modes of
research that HCI scholars can pursue to engage gentrification.},

behaviors, such as abandoning tasks or providing inaccurate data, though there were
costs associated with these behaviors, such as wasted time and risk of rejection.
Finally, their privacy concerns and practices evolved as they learned about both the

a general need to understand how privacy stances change over time.},

Informed by results of this study, we develop a VR-embedded tutorial system that supplements

with their peers. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, I demonstrate how
various physical and virtual spaces work together to make play possible. Second, I
demonstrate these spaces, though some of them are digital, are no more or less "real"
than the physical spaces making up a schoolyard or playground.},

this paper we present findings from an interview study and survey focusing on characteristics
of misdirected email messages, possible reasons why they happen, and how people manage
these messages when they receive them. Misdirected email arises as a result of signifiers
(usernames) which were selected by people for social and self-representation purposes,
that are also used by machines for addressing. Because there is no mechanism for dealing

annotation efforts typically label multiple classes simultaneously in a single pass.
This paper describes our data collection on the Zooniverse citizen science platform,
comparing the efficiencies of different audio annotation strategies. We compared multiple-pass

Furthermore, the textiles and the materials used in smart textile design can exhibit

For instance, steel-based textiles exhibit intrinsic semiconductive properties that
are difficult to identify with current methods. In this paper, we show an alternative
way to measure interaction with smart textiles. By relying on visualisation known

abstract = {This paper examines the promise of empathy, the name commonly given to the initial
phase of the human-centered design process in which designers seek to understand their
intended users in order to inform technology development. By analyzing popular empathy
activities aimed at understanding people with disabilities, we examine the ways empathy
works to both powerfully and problematically align designers with the values of people
who may use their products. Drawing on disability studies and feminist theorizing,
we describe how acts of empathy building may further distance people with disabilities
from the processes designers intend to draw them into. We end by reimagining empathy
as guided by the lived experiences of people with disabilities who are traditionally
positioned as those to be empathized.},

two studies, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 27 participants, asking
about their search habits and preferences, and observing their behavior while searching
for music. Analysis revealed participants evaluated their search experiences along
two dimensions: success and effort. Importantly, how participants perceived success

often, they cannot even figure out what fields (e.g., name) are present in the form.
Hence, they always depend on sighted people to write on their behalf, and help them
affix their signatures. Extant assistive technologies have exclusively focused on
reading, with no support for writing. In this paper, we introduce WiYG, a Write-it-Yourself
guide that directs a blind user to the different form fields, so that she can independently
fill out these fields without seeking assistance from a sighted person. Specifically,
WiYG uses a pocket-sized custom 3D printed smartphone attachment, and well-established
computer vision algorithms to dynamically generate audio instructions that guide the
user to the different form fields. A user study with 13 blind participants showed
that with WiYG, users could correctly fill out the form fields at the right locations
with an accuracy as high as 89.5%.},

abstract = {Sorting items by user rating is a fundamental interaction pattern of the modern Web,
used to rank products (Amazon), posts (Reddit), businesses (Yelp), movies (YouTube),
and more. To implement this pattern, designers must take in a distribution of ratings
for each item and define a sensible total ordering over them. This is a challenging
problem, since each distribution is drawn from a distinct sample population, rendering
the most straightforward method of sorting --- comparing averages --- unreliable when
the samples are small or of different sizes. Several statistical orderings for binary
ratings have been proposed in the literature (e.g., based on the Wilson score, or
Laplace smoothing), each attempting to account for the uncertainty introduced by sampling.
In this paper, we study this uncertainty through the lens of human perception, and
ask "How do people sort by ratings?" In an online study, we collected 48,000 item-ranking
pairs from 4,000 crowd workers along with 4,800 rationales, and analyzed the results
to understand how users make decisions when comparing rated items. Our results shed
light on the cognitive models users employ to choose between rating distributions,
which sorts of comparisons are most contentious, and how the presentation of rating
information affects users' preferences.},

substituting intense inner debates or self-realizations during alone time. Implications

integrate modern audio quality measures into an interactive human-machine feedback

abstract = {Recent sustainable HCI research has advocated "working with nature" as a potentially
efficacious alternative to human efforts to control it: yet it is less clear how to
do so. We contribute to the theoretical aspect of this research by presenting an ethnographic
study on alternative farming practices, in which the farm is not so much a system
but an assemblage characterized by multiple systems or rationalities always evolving
and changing. In them, relationships among species alternate between mutually beneficial
in one moment (or season), and harmful in the next. If HCI is to participate in and
to support working with nature, we believe that it will have to situate itself within
such assemblages and temporalities. In this work, we look into nontraditional users
(e.g., nonhumans) and emerging forms of uses (e.g., interactions between human and

learning, we have few insights into K-12 teachers' current practices, motivations,
and barriers in setting up their digital classroom ecosystems. We interviewed 20 teachers
on their process of discovering and integrating a vast range of productivity software
and educational platforms in their classrooms, with a particular focus on how they
personalize the UI and content of these tools (e.g., with plugins, templates, or option
menus). We found that teachers largely depended on their own experimentation and professional
circles to find, personalize, and troubleshoot software tools to support student needs
or their own preferences. Teachers were often hesitant to attempt more advanced personalizations
due to concerns over student confusion and increased troubleshooting load. We derive
several design implications for HCI to better support teachers in sharing their personalized
setups and helping their students benefit from digital immersion.},

play experience. For example, designers may manipulate data displays of player health-showing
they have less health than they actually do-to induce tension. While commonly used,
players make decisions based on in-game data displays, raising the question of how
misrepresentations impact behavior and performance, and whether this might have unintended
consequences. To provide a better understanding of how data misrepresentation impacts
play, we compare two versions of a game: one that displays health accurately and one
that misrepresents health. Our results suggest that even subtle manipulations to data
displays can have a measurable effect on behavior and performance, and these changes
can help explain differences in experience. We show that data misrepresentations need
to be designed carefully to avoid unintended effects. Our work provides new directions
for research into the design of misrepresentation in games.},

the weight of virtual objects. Control-to-display (C/D) ratio manipulation has been
proposed as a method to induce weight perception without kinesthetic feedback. Based
on the fact that lighter (heavier) objects are easier (harder) to move, this method
induces an illusory perception of weight by manipulating the rendered position of
users' hands---increasing or decreasing their displayed movements. In a series of
experiments we demonstrate that C/D-ratio induces a genuine perception of weight,
while preserving ownership over the virtual hand. This means that such a manipulation
can be easily introduced in current VR experiences without disrupting the sense of
presence. We discuss these findings in terms of estimation of physical work needed
to lift an object. Our findings provide the first quantification of the range of C/D-ratio
that can be used to simulate weight in virtual reality.},

This paper introduces a model for designing AR experiences in which players inhabit

interactions with other players. We explored the development of this model through
the creation of Brick, a two-player mobile AR game at the room scale. We refined Brick
over multiple rounds of iteration, and we used our playtests to investigate a range
of issues involved in designing shared-world AR games. Our findings suggest that there
are five major categories of interactions in a shared-world AR system: single-player,
intrapersonal, multiplayer, interpersonal, and environmental. We believe that this
model can support the development of collaborative AR games and new forms of social
gameplay.},

Inspired by methods commonly used in Scientific Visualisation to visually explore

a density-based haptic vibration technique (Scaptics) which provides feedback through
the controller; and second, an adaptation of a cutting plane for 3D scatterplots (Highlight-Plane).
We evaluated both techniques in a controlled study with two tasks involving density
(finding high- and low-density areas). Overall, Scaptics was the most time-efficient
and accurate technique, however, in some conditions, it was outperformed by Highlight-Plane.},

as an opportune moment for automatic height adjustment. We then performed a Wizard

towards and experiences with the game community. The results show that players rarely
use social features, and these features contribute differently to predicting players'
sense of community. We also found emergent toxic behaviors, afforded by the social
features. Findings can inform the best practices and principles in the design of OCCGs,
and contribute to our understanding of players' perceptions of OCCG communities.},

abstract = {Capturing fine-grained hand activity could make computational experiences more powerful
and contextually aware. Indeed, philosopher Immanuel Kant argued, "the hand is the
visible part of the brain." However, most prior work has focused on detecting whole-body
activities, such as walking, running and bicycling. In this work, we explore the feasibility
of sensing hand activities from commodity smartwatches, which are the most practical
vehicle for achieving this vision. Our investigations started with a 50 participant,
in-the-wild study, which captured hand activity labels over nearly 1000 worn hours.
We then studied this data to scope our research goals and inform our technical approach.
We conclude with a second, in-lab study that evaluates our classification stack, demonstrating
95.2% accuracy across 25 hand activities. Our work highlights an underutilized, yet
highly complementary contextual channel that could unlock a wide range of promising
applications.},

struggles in recognizing relevant help, the degree to which they made coordinated
use of the application and different resources, and in how they perceived the utility
of different help formats. We discuss implications for moving beyond "one-size-fits-all"

when attempted remotely, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. We investigate teams' multidimensional
patterns of visual attention during a collaborative problem-solving task with an eye
for leveraging insights to improve collaborative interfaces. Fifty-seven novices (forming
19 triads) engaged in a challenging programming task (Minecraft Hour of Code) using
videoconferencing software with screen sharing. To discover patterns of individual-level
gaze-UI coupling(coordination of a teammate's attention with respect to changes in
the user interface) and team-level gaze-UI regularity (dynamics of teams' collective
attention in context with changes in the user interface), we applied cross- and multidimensional
recurrence quantification analyses, respectively. Individuals' eye gaze was significantly
coupled with the ongoing screen activity whereas teams displayed significant patterns
of gaze regularity, suggesting repetitive patterns in teams' attention. These measures
predicted expert-coded collaborative processes of constructing shared knowledge and
negotiation and coordination (but not maintaining team function) and correlated with
task score (r = .425). They also predicted individually assessed subjective perceptions
of team performance and the collaboration process, but not individual's learning or
team's task scores. We discuss implications of our findings for the design of intelligent

social media, and email - services that come with subtle and serious security and
privacy risks. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are particularly
vulnerable to these risks because MCI can reduce their ability to recognize scams
such as email phishing, follow recommended password guidelines, and consider the implications
of sharing personal information. Older adults with MCI often cope with their impairments
with the help of caregivers, including partners, children, and professional health
personnel, when using and managing online services. Yet, this too carries security
and privacy risks: sharing personal information with caregivers can create issues
of agency, autonomy, and even risk embarrassment and information leakage; caregivers
also do not always act in their charges' best interest. Through a series of interviews
conducted in the US, we identify a spectrum of safeguarding strategies used and consider
them through the lens of 'upside and downside risk' where there are tradeoffs between
reduced privacy and maintaining older adults' autonomy and access to online services.},

Adopting certain roles early on predicts members' continued participation in the community.

more people to identify bias compared to titles with a miscued slant, visualizations
were persistently perceived as impartial by the majority. Further, people's recall

Using a dataset of gaze angle sequences of users navigating a VR environment and markers

Prior studies show that men are more adept at 3D spatial navigation than women, though
this sex bias can be minimized by providing women with a larger FOV. Our study provides
insight into the relationship between sex and FOV restriction with respect to VR sickness
and spatial navigation performance which seem to conflict. We find the use of an FOV

design of these primitives was guided by a formative study, in which we observed developers'
natural implementations of custom gestures. Touch groups provide summaries of multiple
fingers rather than requiring that programmers track them manually. Cross events allow
programmers to summarize the movement of one or a group of fingers. We implemented
these two primitives in two environments: a declarative programming system and in
a standard imperative programming language. We found that these primitives are capable
of defining nuanced multi-touch gestures, which we illustrate through a series of
examples. Further, in two user evaluations of these programming primitives, we found
that multi-touch behaviors implemented in these programming primitives are more understandable
than those implemented with standard touch events.},

abstract = {Advances in conversational AI have the potential to enable more engaging and effective
ways to teach factual knowledge. To investigate this hypothesis, we created QuizBot,
a dialogue-based agent that helps students learn factual knowledge in science, safety,
and English vocabulary. We evaluated QuizBot with 76 students through two within-subject
studies against a flashcard app, the traditional medium for learning factual knowledge.
Though both systems used the same algorithm for sequencing materials, QuizBot led
to students recognizing (and recalling) over 20% more correct answers than when students
used the flashcard app. Using a conversational agent is more time consuming to practice
with, but in a second study, of their own volition, students spent 2.6x more time
learning with QuizBot than with flashcards and reported preferring it strongly for
casual learning. Our results in this second study showed QuizBot yielded improved
learning gains over flashcards on recall. These results suggest that educational chatbot
systems may have beneficial use, particularly for learning outside of traditional
settings.},

abstract = {This paper presents co-design fiction as an approach to engaging users in imagining,
envisioning and speculating not just on future technology but future life through
co-created fictional works. Design fiction in research is often created or written
by researchers. There is relatively little critical discussion of how to co-create
design fictions with end-users, with the concomitant opportunities and challenges
this poses. To fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted co-design fiction workshops
with nine older creative writers, utilising prompts to inspire discussion and engage
their imaginative writing about the trend towards tracking and monitoring older people.
Their stories revealed futures of neither dystopia nor utopia but of social and moral
dilemmas narrating their wish not just to "maintain their independence", but a palpable
desire for adventure and very nuanced senses of how they wish to take control. We
discuss inherent tensions in the control of the co-design fiction process; balancing
the author's need for freedom and creativity with the researcher's desire to guide
the process toward the design investigation at hand.},

mapping, and (3) animating passive props. We identify inherent challenges of hovering
encountered-type haptic devices, such as their limited speed, inadequate control accuracy,
and safety concerns. We then detail our approach for tackling these challenges, including
the use of display techniques, visuo-haptic illusions, and collision avoidance. We
conclude by describing a preliminary study (n = 9) to better understand the subjective

A fundamental characteristic of VR is creating presence, the experience of 'being'
or 'acting', when physically situated in another place. Measuring presence is vital
for VR research and development. It is typically repeatedly assessed through questionnaires
completed after leaving a VR scene. Requiring participants to leave and re-enter the
VR costs time and can cause disorientation. In this paper, we investigate the effect
of completing presence questionnaires directly in VR. Thirty-six participants experienced
two immersion levels and filled three standardized presence questionnaires in the
real world or VR. We found no effect on the questionnaires' mean scores; however,
we found that the variance of those measures significantly depends on the realism
of the virtual scene and if the subjects had left the VR. The results indicate that,
besides reducing a study's duration and reducing disorientation, completing questionnaires
in VR does not change the measured presence but can increase the consistency of the
variance.},

we show that mobile devices have a systematic effect on the stereotypes' warmth and

with four main findings. First, asymmetric transfer is common, occurring in 42% of
tests analysed. Second, the data conforms to predictions of anchoring effects. Third,
the magnitude of the anchor's effect correlates with the magnitude of the difference
between the interface ratings -- that is, the anchor's 'pull' correlates with the
anchoring stimulus. Fourth, several of the previously published findings are changed
when data are reanalysed using between-subjects treatment. We urge caution when analysing
within-subjects subjective measures and recommend that researchers test for and report
the occurrence of asymmetric transfer.},

a privacy transform. Using a between-subjects online experiment, we studied the effects

designers can integrate in their system to recommend a range of local structure modifications

flexibility to end-users regarding their own meaningful grouping and labeling choices
to follow a recommendation. A first experiment confirms that the recommendations built
on our model can lead to modified hierarchies resulting in faster theoretical selection
times. A second experiment confirms that the theoretical selection times fit empirical
selection times in different hierarchy visual layouts: linear, radial, and grid.},

abstract = {Gesture typing--entering a word by gliding the finger sequentially over letter to
letter-- has been widely supported on smartphones for sighted users. However, this
input paradigm is currently inaccessible to blind users: it is difficult to draw shape
gestures on a virtual keyboard without access to key visuals. This paper describes
the design of accessible gesture typing, to bring this input paradigm to blind users.
To help blind users figure out key locations, the design incorporates the familiar
screen-reader supported touch exploration that narrates the keys as the user drags
the finger across the keyboard. The design allows users to seamlessly switch between
exploration and gesture typing mode by simply lifting the finger. Continuous touch-exploration
like audio feedback is provided during word shape construction that helps the user
glide in the right direction of the key locations constituting the word. Exploration

typing mode from touch exploration mode, and thereby avoid unintended mix-ups. A user
study with 14 blind people shows 35% increment in their typing speed, indicative of
the promise and potential of gesture typing technology for non-visual text entry.},

a school, with support staff from local authorities and, through bodystorming, with
a class of 27 pupils. We then ran a series of co-design workshops with participants
with mixed-visual abilities to design an educational VUI application. This provided
insights into challenges faced by pupils with VIs in mainstream schools, and opened
a space for educators, sighted and visually impaired pupils to reflect on and design
for their shared learning experiences through VUIs. We present scenarios, a design
space and an example application that show novel ways of using VUIs for inclusive
education. We also reflect on co-designing with mixed-visual-ability groups in this
space.},

this we conducted pilot workshops with 9 participants and an interview study in which
14 further participants were asked about their experiences of donating money, and
invited to co-speculate on a service for programmable giving. The study elicited how
data-driven conditionality and automation could be leveraged to create novel donor
experiences, however also illustrated the inherent tensions and challenges involved
in giving programmatically. Reflecting on these findings, our paper contributes implications
both for the design of programmable aid platforms, and the design of escrow-based
financial services in general.},

sensing, computing, and interaction. Future design of these devices requires an understanding
of how skin-worn devices affect the natural tactile perception. In this study, we
approach this research challenge by proposing a novel classification system for epidermal
devices based on flexural rigidity and by testing advanced adhesive materials, including
tattoo paper and thin films of poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). We report on the results
of three psychophysical experiments that investigated the effect of epidermal devices
of different rigidity on passive and active tactile perception. We analyzed human
tactile sensitivity thresholds, two-point discrimination thresholds, and roughness
discrimination abilities on three different body locations (fingertip, hand, forearm).
Generally, a correlation was found between device rigidity and tactile sensitivity
thresholds as well as roughness discrimination ability. Surprisingly, thin epidermal
devices based on PDMS with a hundred times the rigidity of commonly used tattoo paper
resulted in comparable levels of tactile acuity. The material offers the benefit of
increased robustness against wear and the option to re-use the device. Based on our
findings, we derive design recommendations for epidermal devices that combine tactile
perception with device robustness.},

representing different disciplines acting as 'designers', while having a divergent
understanding of it and of who has authority to do it. The study relies on nexus analysis
as a sensitizing device and shows how various discourses, epistemologies and histories
shape cross-disciplinary research and design. Critical reflection around our research
practice entailing design is called for.},

HCI (SHCI), using interdisciplinary insights and methods. In this paper, we put this
into practice to conduct an evaluation of Sustainable Interaction Design (SID) of
digital services. We explore how SID can contribute to corporate greenhouse gas (GHG)
reduction strategies. We show how a Digital Service Provider (DSP) might incorporate
SID into their design process and quantitatively evaluate a specific SID intervention
by combining user analytics data with environmental life cycle assessment. We illustrate
this by considering YouTube. Replacing user analytics data with aggregate estimates
from publicly available sources, we estimate emissions associated with the deployment
of YouTube to be approximately 10MtCO2e p.a. We estimate emissions reductions enabled
through the use of an SID intervention from prior literature to be approximately 300KtCO2e
p.a., and demonstrate that this is significant when considered alongside other emissions
reduction interventions used by DSPs.},

abstract = {Despite the availability of software to support Affinity Diagramming (AD), practitioners
still largely favor physical sticky-notes. Physical notes are easy to set-up, can
be moved around in space and offer flexibility when clustering un-structured data.
However, when working with mixed data sources such as surveys, designers often trade
off the physicality of notes for analytical power. We propose AffinityLens, a mobile-based
augmented reality (AR) application for Data-Assisted Affinity Diagramming (DAAD).
Our application provides just-in-time quantitative insights overlaid on physical notes.
Affinity Lens uses several different types of AR overlays (called lenses) to help
users find specific notes, cluster information, and summarize insights from clusters.
Through a formative study of AD users, we developed design principles for data-assisted
AD and an initial collection of lenses. Based on our prototype, we find that Affinity
Lens supports easy switching between qualitative and quantitative 'views' of data,
without surrendering the lightweight benefits of existing AD practice.},

complexities involved in self-management, motivators and barriers to self-management,
sources of support and poor communication as a barrier to care coordination. We present

abstract = {Appearance-based gaze estimation methods that only require an off-the-shelf camera
have significantly improved but they are still not yet widely used in the human-computer
interaction (HCI) community. This is partly because it remains unclear how they perform
compared to model-based approaches as well as dominant, special-purpose eye tracking
equipment. To address this limitation, we evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art
appearance-based gaze estimation for interaction scenarios with and without personal
calibration, indoors and outdoors, for different sensing distances, as well as for
users with and without glasses. We discuss the obtained findings and their implications
for the most important gaze-based applications, namely explicit eye input, attentive
user interfaces, gaze-based user modelling, and passive eye monitoring. To democratise
the use of appearance-based gaze estimation and interaction in HCI, we finally present
OpenGaze (www.opengaze.org), the first software toolkit for appearance-based gaze
estimation and interaction.},

traditional purposeful and attention demanding ways of interacting with computers.
However, there is a lack of agreement about the term's precise meaning. This paper
develops implicit interaction further as an analytic concept and identifies the methodological
challenges related to HCI's particular design orientation. We first review meanings
of implicit as unintentional, attentional background, unawareness, unconsciousness
and implicature, and compare them in regards to the entity they qualify, the design
motivation they emphasize and their constructive validity for what makes good interaction.
We then demonstrate how the methodological challenges can be addressed with greater
precision by using an updated, intentionality-based definition that specifies an input-effect
relationship as the entity of implicit. We conclude by identifying a number of new
considerations for design and evaluation, and by reflecting on the concepts of user
and system agency in HCI.},

we analyze a sample of 55 publications that use the word subtle. We describe the variants

in HCI. We conclude by outlining some open empirical and conceptual questions about

this means that they prefer to frequently switch tasks and happily accommodate regular
work and non-work interruptions. While a preference for polychronicity might equip
people well to deal with the structural demands of crowdworking platforms, we also
know that multitasking negatively affects workers' productivity. This puts crowdworkers'
working preferences into conflict with the desire of requesters to maximize workers'
productivity. Combining the findings of prior research with the new knowledge obtained

latency for some but not all devices. Existing practices - measuring end-to-end latency
as a proxy of input latency and reporting only mean values and standard deviations
- hide these characteristic latency distributions caused by device intrinsics and
polling rates. A probabilistic model of input device latency demonstrates these issues
and matches our measurements. Thus, our work offers guidance for researchers, engineers,
and hobbyists who want to measure the latency of input devices or select devices with
low latency.},

advancements in displays, rendering and recently, haptics. To increase our sense of
physical immersion, for instance, vibrotactile gloves render the sense of touching,
while electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) renders forces. Unfortunately, the established
metric to assess the effectiveness of haptic devices relies on the user's subjective
interpretation of unspecific, yet standardized, questions.Here, we explore a new approach
to detect a conflict in visuo-haptic integration (e.g., inadequate haptic feedback
based on poorly configured collision detection) using electroencephalography (EEG).
We propose analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) during interaction with virtual
objects. In our study, participants touched virtual objects in three conditions and
received either no haptic feedback, vibration, or vibration and EMS feedback. To provoke
a brain response in unrealistic VR interaction, we also presented the feedback prematurely
in 25% of the trials.We found that the early negativity component of the ERP (so called
prediction error) was more pronounced in the mismatch trials, indicating we successfully
detected haptic conflicts using our technique. Our results are a first step towards
using ERPs to automatically detect visuo-haptic mismatches in VR, such as those that
can cause a loss of the user's immersion.},

in group play have superior adherence to people who primarily play alone. People who
play alone in a multiplayer exergame have worse adherence than playing a single-player
version, which can undo any potential benefit of social play. The primary construct
distinguishing group versus alone players is their sense of program belonging. Program
belonging is, thus, crucial to multiplayer exergame design.},

indicate that due to the absence of organizational structures that include users into
security development processes, security managers unintentionally obtain a negative
view on users. Their distrust towards users leads to the creation of technical security
measures that cannot be influenced by users in any way. However, as previous research
has repeatedly shown, rigid security measures lead to frustration and discouragement
of users, and also to creative (but usually insecure) methods of security circumvention.
We conclude that in order to break through this vicious cycle, security managers need
organizational structures, methods and tools that facilitate systematic feedback from

implements new systems. In this paper, we introduce a case in which design fiction
was used as an ethical discussion tool among company partners. We report the process
of creating and prototyping a fictional world embedded with conflicting values that
aimed to shift the focus from industrial merits towards societal values and raise
discussion among participants. Moreover, we examine the challenges and propose suggestions
in crafting critiques and friction to the industrial context. Our findings suggest
why and how one should use design fiction as a means to raise ethical awareness in
a technology- and profit-focused context, to support further activities on developing
more humane technological futures.},

abstract = {Participatory Video (PV) is emerging as a rich and valuable method for monitoring
and evaluating (M &amp; E) projects in the International Development sector. Although
shown to be useful for engaging communities within short-term monitoring exercises
or promotion, PV in these contexts presents significant complexity and logistical
challenges for sustained uptake by Development organizations. In this paper, we present
Our Story, a digitally mediated work flow iteratively designed and deployed on initiatives
in Indonesia and Namibia. Developed in collaboration with the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC), it supports end-to-end PV production in the
field, and was specifically developed to make PV a more sustainable tool for monitoring.
We discuss and evaluate Our Story, reporting on how by lowering skills barriers for
facilitators and leveraging consumer technology, PV can be delivered at scale.},

abstract = {Online language lessons have adopted live broadcasted videos to provide more real-time
interactive experiences between language teachers and learners. However, learner interactions
are primarily limited to the built-in text chat in the live stream. Using text alone,
learners cannot get feedback on important aspects of a language, such as speaking
skills, that are afforded only by offering richer types of interactions. We present
results from a 2-week in-the-wild study, in which we investigate the use of text,
audio, video, image, and stickers as interaction tools for language teachers and learners
in live streaming. Our language teacher explored three different teaching strategies
over four live streamed English lessons, while nine students watched and interacted
using multimodal tools. The findings reveal that multimodal communication yields instant
feedback and increased engagement, but its use is dependent on factors such as group
size, surroundings, time, and online identity.},

workshops enabled us to gather insight into the specific challenges and opportunities
of deploying smart home technologies in a setting where issues of privacy, data collection

age, and the consequences of monitoring and data aggregation setup an expanding collection
of design implications in the ecosystems of smart home technologies.},

on a five week study of Mazi with five children aged between 6 and 9 years old at
a Special Education Needs (SEN) school in London, UK. We found that collaborative
play emerged from the interaction with the system especially in regards to socialization
and engagement. Our study contributes to exploring the potential of user-centered
TUI development as a channel to facilitate social interaction while providing sensory
regulation for children with SENs.},

abstract = {Younger children (under 9 years) with type-1 diabetes are often very passive in the
management of their condition and can face difficulties in accessing and understanding
basic diabetes related information. This can make transitioning to self-management
in later years very challenging. Previous research has mostly focused on educational
interventions for older children.To create an educational tool which can support the
diabetes educational process of younger children, we conducted a multiphase and multi-stakeholder
user-centred design process. The result is an interactive tool that illustrates diabetes
concepts in an age-appropriate way with the use of tangible toys. The tool was evaluated
inside a paediatric diabetes clinic with clinicians, children and parents and was
found to be engaging, acceptable and effective. In addition to providing implications
for the design and adoption of educational tools for children in a clinical setting,
we discuss the challenges for conducting user-centred design in such a setting.},

a new notification rule to reduce this crowdedness, which can be recognized by both
senders and recipients. We developed an MIM app that provides only one notification
per conversation session, which is a group of consecutive messages distinguished based
on a ten-minute silence period. Through the two-week field study, 20,957 message logs
and interview data from 17 participants revealed that MIM notifications affect not
only the recipients' experiences before opening the app but also the entire conversation
experience, including that of the senders. The new notification rule created new social
norms for the participants' use of MIM. We report themes about the changes in the
MIM experience, which will expand the role of notifications for future MIM apps.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) strives to replicate the sensation of the physical environment
by mimicking people's perceptions and experience of being elsewhere. These experiences
are of-ten mediated by the objects and tools we interact with in the virtual world
(e.g., a controller). Evidence from psychology posits that when using the tool proficiently,
it becomes em-bodied (i.e., an extension of one's body). There is little work,however,
on how to measure this phenomenon in VR, andon how different types of tools and controllers
can affect the experience of interaction. In this work, we leverage cognitive psychology
and philosophy literature to construct the Locus-of-Attention Index (LAI), a measure
of tool embodiment. We designed and conducted a study that measures readiness-to-hand
and unreadiness-to-hand for three VR interaction techniques: hands, a physical tool,
and a VR controller. The study shows that LAI can measure differences in embodiment
with working and broken tools and that using the hand directly results in more embodiment
than using controllers.},

Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) that is both hands- and device-free. It uses directional
walk-ing as a way to interact with virtual objects. To use DMove, a user needs to
perform directional motions such as mov-ing one foot forward or backward. In this
research, we first investigate the recognition accuracy of the motion direc-tions
of our method and the social acceptance of this type of interactions together with
users' comfort rating for each direction. We then optimize its design and conduct
a sec-ond study to compare DMove in task performance and user preferences (workload,
motion sickness, user experience), with two approaches-Hand interaction (Meta 2-like)
and Head+Hand interaction (HoloLens-like) for menu selection tasks. Based on the results
of these two studies, we provide a set of guidelines for DMove and further demonstrate
two applications that utilize directional motions.},
