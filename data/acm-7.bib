abstract = {This research measures human performance in inferring the functional types (i.e.,
home, work, leisure and transport) of locations in geo-location data using different
visual representations of the data (textual, static and animated visualizations) along
with different amounts of data (1, 3 or 5 day(s)). We first collected real life geo-location
data from tweets. We then asked the data owners to tag their location points, resulting
in ground truth data. Using this dataset we conducted an empirical study involving
45 participants to analyze how accurately they could infer the functional location
of the original data owners under different conditions, i.e., three data representations,
three data densities and four location types. The study results indicate that while
visual techniques perform better than textual ones, the functional locations of human
activities can be inferred with a relatively high accuracy even using only textual
representations and a low density of location points. Workplace was more easily inferred
than home while transport was the functional location with the highest accuracy. Our
results also showed that it was easier to infer functional locations from data exhibiting
more stable and consistent mobility patterns, which are thus more vulnerable to privacy
disclosures. We discuss the implications of our findings in the context of privacy
preservation and provide guidelines to users and companies to help preserve and safeguard
people's privacy.},

been generated by automated software agents (i.e. "bots"). We then codify the systemic
challenges inherent to characterizing rural phenomena through peer production and

abstract = {Despite of a significant body of research in optimizing the virtual keyboard layout,
none of them has gained large adoption, primarily due to the steep learning curve.
To address this learning problem, we introduced three types of Qwerty constraints,
Qwerty1, QwertyH1, and One-Swap bounds in layout optimization, and investigated their
effects on layout learnability and performance. This bounded optimization process
leads to IJQwerty, which has only one pair of keys different from Qwerty. Our theoretical
analysis and user study show that IJQwerty improves the accuracy and input speed of
gesture typing over Qwerty once a user reaches the expert mode. IJQwerty is also extremely
easy to learn. The initial upon-use text entry speed is the same with Qwerty. Given
the high performance and learnability, such a layout will more likely gain large adoption
than any of previously obtained layouts. Our research also shows the disparity from
Qwerty substantially affects layout learning. To minimize the learning effort, a new
layout needs to hold a strong resemblance to Qwerty.},

a Bayesian algorithm that takes into account the probability of gestures and the language
model. To input letters, we design a pause gesture allowing users to switch into letter
selection mode seamlessly. Users studies show that 1D Handwriting significantly outperforms
a selection-based technique (a variation of 1Line Keyboard) for both letter input
(4.67 WPM vs. 4.20 WPM) and word input (9.72 WPM vs. 8.10 WPM). With extensive training,
text entry rate can reach 19.6 WPM. Users' subjective feedback indicates 1D Handwriting
is easy to learn and efficient to use. Moreover, it has several potential applications
for other one-dimensional constrained interfaces.},

strive to stabilize their own communication ecosystem yet need to respond to changes
necessitated by the emergence of new tools, practices, and contacts. We unpack the

that cause people to overvalue their own behavior, it is likely that many self-presentation

In an empirical study, 1300 Facebook users evaluated their most recent status update
in terms of how good it make them look. In addition external judges also evaluated
the same update. Posters and outsiders agreed only modestly about how good an update
made the poster appear (r=.36, p&lt;.001). Posters generally thought that their posts
make them look better than did the outsider judges. They also disagreed on which topics
made them look good. Posters were especially likely to overestimate their self-presentation
when they wrote about the mundane details of their daily life (e.g., Clothing, Sleep,
or Religious imagery), but underestimated it when they wrote about family and relationships
(e.g., Birthday, Father's Day, Love).},

and convergence) to render the scene on a 3D display. But, keeping these parameters
fixed during usage does not always provide the best experience since it can reduce
the amount of depth perception possible in some applications which have large variability
in object distances. We developed two stereoscopic rendering techniques which actively
vary the stereo parameters based on the scene content. Our first algorithm calculates
a low resolution depth map of the scene and chooses ideal stereo parameters based
on that depth map. Our second algorithm uses eye tracking data to get the gaze direction
of the user and chooses ideal stereo parameters based on the distance of the gazed
object. We evaluated our techniques in an experiment that uses three depth judgment
tasks: depth ranking, relative depth judgment and path tracing. Our results indicate
that variable stereo parameters provide enhanced depth discrimination compared to
static parameters and were preferred by our participants over the traditional fixed
parameter approach. We discuss our findings and possible implications on the design
of future stereoscopic 3D applications.},

abstract = {An important visual cue for the distance to a target is its binocular depth, the disparity
between the left and right eyes. We examined mid-air pointing on a large screen, varying
the physical distances (depths) to targets. Welford's two-part formulation provided
a better model than the one-part Fitts's Law formulation to predict movement time
from movement amplitude and target width. Angular measures suggested by Kopper et
al. did not improve the model. Consistent variations of Shoemaker et al.'s k-factor
suggest target depth plays a role similar to gain for mid-air pointing. We compared
both physical and virtual targets to determine if artificial binocular depth cues
induce the same performance as purely physical binocular depth cues. Variation of
the k-factor was different when virtual depth and physical depth were not identical.
This has implications for calibrating 3-D virtual environments and for the design
of interactive 3-D pointing techniques for those environments.},

abstract = {A key requirement for a sense of presence in Virtual Environments (VEs) is for a user
to perceive space as naturally as possible. One critical aspect is distance perception.
When judging distances, compression is a phenomenon where humans tend to underestimate
the distance between themselves and target objects (termed egocentric or absolute
compression), and between other objects (exocentric or relative compression). Results
of studies in virtual worlds rendered through head mounted displays are striking,
demonstrating significant distance compression error. Distance compression is a multisensory
phenomenon, where both audio and visual stimuli are often compressed with respect
to their distances from the observer. In this paper, we propose and test a method
for reducing crossmodal distance compression in VEs. We report an empirical evaluation
of our method via a study of 3D spatial perception within a virtual reality (VR) head
mounted display. Applying our method resulted in more accurate distance perception
in a VE at longer range, and suggests a modification that could adaptively compensate
for distance compression at both shorter and longer ranges. Our results have a significant
and intriguing implication for designers of VEs: an incongruent audiovisual display,
i.e. where the audio and visual information is intentionally misaligned, may lead
to better spatial perception of a virtual scene.},

ubicomp or IoT spaces. Designers without technical implementation skills have difficulties
in prototyping such spaces, especially in the early phases of design. We present miniStudio,
a designers' tool for prototyping ubicomp space with proxemic interactions. It is
built on designers' existing software and modeling materials (Photoshop, Lego, and
paper). Interactions can be defined in Photoshop based on five spatial relations:
location, distance, motion, orientation, and custom. Projection-based augmented reality
was applied to miniatures in order to enable tangible interactions and dynamic representations.
Hidden marker stickers and a camera-projector system enable the unobtrusive integration
of digital images on the physical miniature. Through the user study with 12 designers
and researchers in the ubicomp field, we found that miniStudio supported rapid prototyping
of large and complex ideas with multiple connected components. Based on the tool development
and the study, we discuss the implications for prototyping ubicomp environments in
the early phase of the design.},

user behaviors from clickstream data (traces of users' click events), and visualize
the detected behaviors in an intuitive manner. Our system identifies "clusters" of
similar users by partitioning a similarity graph (nodes are users; edges are weighted
by clickstream similarity). The partitioning process leverages iterative feature pruning
to capture the natural hierarchy within user clusters and produce intuitive features
for visualizing and understanding captured user behaviors. For evaluation, we present
case studies on two large-scale clickstream traces (142 million events) from real
social networks. Our system effectively identifies previously unknown behaviors, e.g.,
dormant users, hostile chatters. Also, our user study shows people can easily interpret
identified behaviors using our visualization tool.},

abstract = {From smart homes that prepare coffee when we wake, to phones that know not to interrupt
us during important conversations, our collective visions of HCI imagine a future
in which computers understand a broad range of human behaviors. Today our systems
fall short of these visions, however, because this range of behaviors is too large
for designers or programmers to capture manually. In this paper, we instead demonstrate
it is possible to mine a broad knowledge base of human behavior by analyzing more
than one billion words of modern fiction. Our resulting knowledge base, Augur, trains
vector models that can predict many thousands of user activities from surrounding
objects in modern contexts: for example, whether a user may be eating food, meeting
with a friend, or taking a selfie. Augur uses these predictions to identify actions
that people commonly take on objects in the world and estimate a user's future activities
given their current situation. We demonstrate Augur-powered, activity-based systems
such as a phone that silences itself when the odds of you answering it are low, and
a dynamic music player that adjusts to your present activity. A field deployment of
an Augur-powered wearable camera resulted in 96% recall and 71% precision on its unsupervised
predictions of common daily activities. A second evaluation where human judges rated
the system's predictions over a broad set of input images found that 94% were rated
sensible.},

repetitive tasks at many levels, ranging from the structure of their day to how they
drive through an intersection. People express their routines through actions that
they perform in the particular situations that triggered those actions. An ability
to model routines and understand the situations in which they are likely to occur
could allow technology to help people improve their bad habits, inexpert behavior,
and other suboptimal routines. However, existing routine models do not capture the
causal relationships between situations and actions that describe routines. Our main
contribution is the insight that byproducts of an existing activity prediction algorithm
can be used to model those causal relationships in routines. We apply this algorithm
on two example datasets, and show that the modeled routines are meaningful-that they
are predictive of people's actions and that the modeled causal relationships provide
insights about the routines that match findings from previous research. Our approach
offers a generalizable solution to model and reason about routines.},

leverages the intrinsic human capability for consistent relative judgements and the

this technique. We conducted a real-world study where clinicians labelled videos of
patients with multiple sclerosis for the ASSESS MS computer vision system. In assessing
the efficiency-consistency trade-off of setwise versus pairwise comparison, we demonstrated
that not only is setwise comparison more efficient, but it also elicits more consistent

A solution is to incorporate insights from behavior change theory and design technology

by motivational text messages. We crowdsourced peer-designed text messages and coded
them into categories based on the processes of change. We evaluated whether people
perceived messages tailored to their stage of change as motivating. We found that
crowdsourcing is an effective method to design motivational messages. Our results
indicate that different messages are perceived as motivating depending on the stage
of behavior change a person is in. However, while motivational messages related to
later stages of change were perceived as motivational for those stages, the motivational
messages related to earlier stages of change were not. This indicates that a person's
stage of change may not be the (only) key factor that determines behavior change.
More individual factors need to be considered to design effective motivational technology.},

which specializes in removing copy protection from software and releasing the cracked
software for free. Despite the lack of economic incentives and the absence of external
laws regulating it, the warez scene has been able to self-govern and self-organize
for more than three decades. Through a directed content analysis of the subculture's
digital traces, the paper argues that the ludic competition within the warez scene
is an institution of collective action, and can, therefore, be approached as a common-pool
resource (CPR). Subsequently, the paper uses Ostrom's framework of long-enduring common-pool
resource institutions to understand the warez scene's longevity and ability to govern
itself. Theoretical and design implications of these findings are then discussed.},

HCI research community. However, most of our insights about end-user interaction with
fabrication are currently based on interactions of professional users, makers, and
technology enthusiasts. We present a study of casual makers, users who have no prior
experience with fabrication and mainly explore walk-up-and-use 3D printing services
at public print centers, such as libraries, universities, and schools. We carried
out 32 interviews with casual makers, print center operators, and fabrication experts
to understand the motivations, workflows, and barriers in appropriating 3D printing
technologies. Our results suggest that casual makers are deeply dependent on print
center operators throughout the process from bootstrapping their 3D printing workflow,
to seeking help and troubleshooting, to verifying their outputs. However, print center
operators are usually not trained domain experts in fabrication and cannot always
address the nuanced needs of casual makers. We discuss implications for optimizing
3D design tools and interactions that can better facilitate casual makers' workflows.},

of retrofitting devices available to non-experts by automatically generating an enclosure
structure from an annotated 3D scan. This enclosure structure holds together actuators,
sensors as well as components for the redesigned interface. To allow retrofitting
a wide variety of legacy devices, the RetroFab design tool comes with a toolkit of

Results show that prompts to explain why these anomalies are true drive revision towards

factor in this attention split, is largely unexplored by the literature and will have

supports adjustment of complexity (by either content curator or viewer) to allow convergence

such a language. Our findings show that a usable visual language can be accomplished
by limiting the possible shapes and by making clever use of orientation and meaningful
motion. We found that especially motion is very important to improve perception and
comprehension of what is being displayed on near-eye out-of-focus displays, and that
perception is further improved if direct interaction with the content is allowed.},

fundamental design questions. Among these is the foremost question of how to legibly
present text. We address this fundamental concern through a multi-part exploration
that includes: (1) a focus-group study from which we collected free-form display scenarios
and extracted display shape properties; (2) a framework that identifies different
mappings of text onto a non-rectangular shape and formulates hypotheses concerning
legibility for different display shape properties; and (3) a series of quantitative
text legibility studies to assess our hypotheses. Or results agree with and extend
upon other findings in the existing literature on text legibility, but they also uncover
unique instances in which different rules need to be applied for non-rectangular displays.

depth cues humans can perceive. While they support binocular disparity and convergence,
no commercially available 3D display supports focus cues. To use them requires accommodation,
i.e. stretching the eye lens when focusing on an individual distance. Previous work
proposed multilayer and light field displays that require the eye to accommodate.
Such displays enable the user to focus on different depths and blur out content that
is out of focus. Thereby, they might ease the separation of content displayed on different
depth layers. In this paper we investigate the effect of focus cues by comparing 3D
shutter glasses with a multilayer display. We show that recognizing content displayed
on a multilayer display takes less time and results in fewer errors compared to shutter
glasses. We further show that separating overlapping content on multilayer displays
again takes less time, results in fewer errors, and is less demanding. Hence, we argue
that multilayer displays are superior to standard 3D displays if layered 3D content
is displayed, and they have the potential to extend the design space of standard GUI.},

communities (Twitter, Flickr, Swarm) that this localness assumption holds in only
about 75% of cases. In addition, we show that the geographic contours of localness
follow important sociodemographic trends, with social media in, for instance, rural
areas and older areas, being substantially less local in character (when controlling
for other demographics). We demonstrate through a case study that failure to account
for non-local social media VGI can lead to misrepresentative results in social media
VGI-based studies. Finally, we compare the methods for determining localness, finding
substantial disagreement in certain cases, and highlight new best practices for social

abstract = {The asynchronous nature of communications on social network sites creates a unique
opportunity for studying how posting content interacts with individuals' engagement.
This study focuses on the behavioral changes occurring hours before and after contribution
to better understand the changing needs and preferences of contributors. Using observational
data analysis of individuals' activity on Facebook, we test hypotheses regarding the
motivations for site visits, changes in the distribution of attention to content,
and shifts in decisions to interact with others. We find that after posting content
people are intrinsically motivated to visit the site more often, are more attentive
to content from friends (but not others), and choose to interact more with friends
(in large part due to reciprocity). In addition, contributors are more active on the
site hours before posting and remain more active for less than a day afterwards. Our
study identifies a unique pattern of engagement that accompanies contribution and
can inform the design of social network sites to better support contributors.},

abstract = {Animated GIFs have been around since 1987 and recently gained more popularity on social
networking sites. Tumblr, a large social networking and micro blogging platform, is
a popular venue to share animated GIFs. Tumblr users follow blogs, generating a feed
or posts, and choose to "like' or to "reblog' favored posts. In this paper, we use
these actions as signals to analyze the engagement of over 3.9 million posts, and
conclude that animated GIFs are significantly more engaging than other kinds of media.
We follow this finding with deeper visual analysis of nearly 100k animated GIFs and
pair our results with interviews with 13 Tumblr users to find out what makes animated
GIFs engaging. We found that the animation, lack of sound, immediacy of consumption,
low bandwidth and minimal time demands, the storytelling capabilities and utility
for expressing emotions were significant factors in making GIFs the most engaging
content on Tumblr. We also found that engaging GIFs contained faces and had higher
motion energy, uniformity, resolution and frame rate. Our findings connect to media
theories and have implications in design of effective content dashboards, video summarization
tools and ranking algorithms to enhance engagement.},

that (1) a set of images, biased toward more revealing figures, change subjects' personal

increases the probability that a subject divulges personal information; and (3) that
these shift also increases the probability that the subject advises others to do so.
Our main contribution is empirically identifying a key mechanism by which norm-shaping
designs can change beliefs and subsequent disclosure behaviors.},

social networking sites. Despite its potential value, friendsourcing requests often
fall on deaf ears. One way to improve response rates and motivate friends to undertake
more effortful tasks may be to offer extrinsic rewards, such as money or a gift, for
responding to friendsourcing requests. However, past research suggests that these
extrinsic rewards can have unintended consequences, including undermining intrinsic
motivations and undercutting the relationship between people. To explore the effects
of extrinsic reward on friends' response rate and perceived relationship, we conducted
an experiment on a new friendsourcing platform - Mobilyzr. Results indicate that large
extrinsic rewards increase friends' response rates without reducing the relationship
strength between friends. Additionally, the extrinsic rewards allow requesters to
explain away the failure of friendsourcing requests and thus preserve their perceptions
of relationship ties with friends.},

incidental advocates, when everyday social media posts are perceived as advocacy work

collective responsibility, shared with children, partners, and families. We consider
the complexities of LGBT parents' online disclosures in the context of shifting social

educational tools and the vast online network of information about informal learning

of parents, we explored parents' ability to find learning opportunities and their
role in facilitating educational experiences for their children. We identified differences
in the use of online social networks in finding learning opportunities for their children

families have set and their experiences living within them. We report on interviews
with 27 parents and a diary study with a separate 28 families examining these transitions.
These families turn on screens primarily to facilitate parents' independent activities.
Parents feel this is appropriate but self-audit and express hesitation, as they feel
they are benefiting from an activity that can be detrimental to their child's well-being.
We found that families turn off screens when parents are ready to give their child
their full attention and technology presents a natural stopping point. Transitioning
away from screens is often painful, and predictive factors determine the pain of a
transition. Technology-mediated transitions are significantly more successful than
parent-mediated transitions, suggesting that the design community has the power to
make this experience better for parents and children by creating technologies that
facilitate boundary-setting and respect families' self-defined limits.},

put in place to recover from and avoid forgetting. Findings include occurrences of
prospective and retrospective memory lapses, conflicting negative and neutral perceptions,

of forgetting fosters internal tensions among older adults, thereby creating opportunities
for further design research, e.g., to defuse and normalise these reactions.},

abstract = {We introduce Pmomo (acronym of projection mapping on movable object), a dynamic projection
mapping system that tracks the 6-DOF position of real-world object, and shades it
with virtual 3D contents by projection. The system can precisely lock the projection
on the moving object in real-time, even the one with complex geometry. Based on depth
camera, we developed a novel and robust tracking method that samples the structure
of the object into low-density point cloud, then performs an adaptive searching scheme
for the registration procedure. As a fully interactive system, our method can handle
both internal and external complex occlusions, and can quickly track back the object
even when losing track. In order to further improve the realism of the projected virtual
textures, our system innovatively culls occlusions away from projection, which is
achieved by a facet-covering method. As a result, the Pmomo system enables the possibility
of new interactive Augmented Reality applications that require high-quality dynamic
projection effect.},

the space of appearances and interactions of actuated interfaces. While shape-changing
interfaces can dynamically alter the physical appearance of objects, the integration
of spatial augmented reality additionally allows for dynamically changing objects'
optical appearance with high detail. This way, devices can render currently challenging
features such as high frequency texture or fast motion. We frame this combination
in the context of computer graphics with analogies to established techniques for increasing
the realism of 3D objects such as bump mapping. This extensible framework helps us
identify challenges of the two techniques and benefits of their combination. We utilize
our prototype shape-changing device enriched with spatial augmented reality through
projection mapping to demonstrate the concept. We present a novel mechanical distance-fields
algorithm for real-time fitting of mechanically constrained shape-changing devices
to arbitrary 3D graphics. Furthermore, we present a technique for increasing effective
screen real estate for spatial augmented reality through view-dependent shape change.},

we offer examples of projects that utilize the capacity of object-oriented publics
to both analyze the conditions and consequences around existing publics and engage
with matters of concern inherent to emerging publics. Considering how computing as

uses clay for modeling the basic shape of the device around 3D printed representations,
which we call "blanks", of physical interaction widgets such as buttons, sliders,
knobs and other electronics. Each blank includes 4 fiducial markers uniquely arranged
on a visible surface. After scanning the sculpture, these fiducial marks allow our
software to identify widget types and locations in the scanned model. The software
then converts the scan into a printable prototype by positioning mounting surfaces,
openings for the controls and a splitting plane for assembly. Because the blanks fit
in the sculpted shape, they will reliably fit in the interactive prototype. Creating
an interactive prototype requires about 30 minutes of human effort for sculpting,
and after scanning, involves a single button click to use the process.},

the design process. In this paper we propose On-the-Fly Print: a 3D modeling approach
that allows the user to design 3D models digitally while having a low-fidelity physical
wireframe model printed in parallel. Our software starts printing features as soon
as they are created and updates the physical model as needed. Users can quickly check
the design in a real usage context by removing the partial physical print from the
printer and replacing it afterwards to continue printing. Digital content modification
can be updated with quick physical correction using a retractable cutting blade. We
present the detailed description of On-the-Fly Print and showcase several examples

abstract = {Reading Latin poses many difficulties for English speakers, because they are accustomed
to relying on word order to determine the roles of words in a sentence. In Latin,
the grammatical form of a word, and not its position, is responsible for determining
the word's function in a sentence. It has proven challenging to develop pedagogical
techniques that successfully draw students' attention to the grammar of Latin and
that students find engaging enough to use. Building on some of the most promising
prior work in Latin instruction-the Michigan Latin approach--and on the insights underlying
block-based programming languages used to teach children the basics of computer science,
we developed Ingenium. Ingenium uses abstract puzzle blocks to communicate grammatical
concepts. Engaging students in grammatical reflection, Ingenium succeeds when students
are able to effectively decipher the meaning of Latin sentences. We adapted Ingenium
to be used for two standard classroom activities: sentence translations and fill-in-the-blank
exercises. We evaluated Ingenium with 67 novice Latin students in universities across
the USA. When using Ingenium, participants opted to perform more optional exercises,
completed translation exercises with significantly fewer errors related to word order
and errors overall, as well as reported higher levels of engagement and attention
to grammar than when using a traditional text-based interface.},

participants, present the benefits and drawbacks of each of those methods, and focus
on improving one method that could be useful to the CHI community: local standards.
To determine local standards for sample size within the CHI community, we conducted
an analysis of all manuscripts published at CHI2014. We find that sample size for
manuscripts published at CHI ranges from 1 -- 916,000 and the most common sample size
is 12. We also find that sample size differs based on factors such as study setting
and type of methodology employed. The outcome of this paper is an overview of the
various ways sample size may be determined and an analysis of local standards for
sample size within the CHI community. These contributions may be useful to researchers
planning studies and reviewers evaluating the validity of results.},

examine interpretations of progress that was reached through using cheat points. We
then present findings from a deployment of lapse management in a two-week field study

behaviors, we conducted two studies, building on the Theory of Planned Behavior and
Constual Level Theory. We found that attitude about the target is more salient the
further away the event, as people focus on the why of a behavior. On the other hand,
perceived behavior control can influence intention in both near and far future. When
the target is in the near future, people generally focus on the feasibility, or the
how of the behavior. In the far future, people may also consider factors related to
behavior control, if they are motivated to do so (i.e., hold a strong attitude towards
the action). Findings help advance the Theory of Planned Behavior and offer strategies
for designers and event organizers to motivate planned behaviors that are in the near
and far future.},

guidelines or is perceived to be deviant behavior. Users also delete their own content
that they feel is not appropriate within personal or community norms. In this paper,
we examine characteristics of over 30,000 pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) posts that
were at one point public on Instagram but have since been removed. Our work shows
that straightforward signals can be found in deleted content that distinguish them
from other posts, and that the implications of such classification are immense. We
build a classifier that compares public pro-ED posts with this removed content that
achieves moderate accuracy of 69%. We also analyze the characteristics in content
in each of these post categories and find that removed content reflects more dangerous
actions, self-harm tendencies, and vulnerability than posts that remain public. Our
work provides early insights into content removal in a sensitive community and addresses
the future research implications of the findings.},

entirely explain this difference. To investigate if changes to the form and behavior
of virtual things may surface valued elements of a virtual archive, we designed a
technology probe that selected snippets from old emails and mailed them as physical
postcards to participating households. The probe uncovered features of emails that
trigger meaningful reflection, and how contextual information can help people engage
in reminiscence. Our study revealed insights about how materializing virtual possessions
influences factors shaping how people draw on, understand, and value those possessions.
We conclude with implication and strategies for aimed at supporting people in having

we examine how people find email in today's ecosystem through an in-depth qualitative
diary study with 16 participants. We found that personal and work accounts are managed
differently, resulting in diverse retrieval strategies: while work accounts are more
structured and thus email is retrieved through folders, personal accounts have fewer
folders and users rely primarily on the built-in search option. Moreover, retrieval
occurs primarily on laptops and PCs compared to smartphones. We explore the reasons,
and uncover barriers and workarounds related to managing multiple accounts and devices.
Finally, we consider new design possibilities for email clients to better support
how email is used today.},

promise to mitigate visual discomfort caused by the vergence-accommodation conflict,

mode that allows each eye of an observer to accommodate to a different distance. While
this technique is common practice in ophthalmology, we are the first to report its
effectiveness for VR applications with a custom built set up. We demonstrate that
monovision and other focus-tunable display modes can provide better user experiences

for nearby simulated distances in VR.},

3D edge and planar surface constraints. We furthermore discuss the unique design challenges
of snapping in AR, including the user's limited field of view, noise in constraint
extraction, issues with changing the view in AR, visualizing constraints, and more.
We also report the results of a user study evaluating SnapToReality, confirming that
aligning objects to the real world is significantly faster when assisted by snapping
to dynamically extracted constraints. Perhaps more importantly, we also found that
snapping in AR enables a fresh and expressive form of AR content creation.},

induce environmental impacts in different ways, and combine with technical and business

We then create a design rubric, substantially extending that of Blevis [6], to cover
impacts of the digital infrastructure. In doing so, we engage in design criticism,
identifying examples (both actual and potential) of good and bad practice. We then
extend this rubric beyond an eco-efficiency paradigm to consider deeper and more radical

abstract = {In 2012, air pollution in both cities and rural areas was estimated to have caused
3.7 million premature deaths, 88% of those in at risk communities. The primary pollutant
was small airborne particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter which led
to the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In response, we developed
MyPart, the first personal, portable, and accurate particle sensor under $50 capable
of distinguishing and counting differently sized particles. We demonstrate how MyPart
offers substantial enhancements over most existing air particle sensors by simultaneously
improving accessibility, flexibility, portability, and accuracy. We describe the evolution
and implementation of the sensor design, demonstrate its performance across twenty
everyday urban environments versus a calibrated instrument, and conduct a preliminary
user study to report on the overall user experience of MyPart. We also present a novel
smart-phone visualization interface and a series of simple form factor adaptations
of our design.},

verify identity and protect personal data. However, little is known about the influence
of GUI elements and hand postures on such touch biometrics. Thus, we present a metric
to measure the amount of user-revealing information that can be extracted from touch
targeting interactions and apply it in eight targeting tasks with over 150,000 touches
from 24 users in two sessions. We compare touch-to-target offset patterns for four
target types and two hand postures. Our analyses reveal that small, compactly shaped
targets near screen edges yield the most descriptive touch targeting patterns. Moreover,
our results show that thumb touches are more individual than index finger ones. We
conclude that touch-based user identification systems should analyse GUI layouts and
infer hand postures. We also describe a framework to estimate the usefulness of GUIs
for touch biometrics.},

inform the design of privacy notification and management protocols on mobile devices.

in Brooklyn and Seattle, USA and two mobile phone repair communities in Uganda and
Bangladesh -- to advance two arguments. First, studies of repair account for new sites
and processes of value that differ from those appearing at HCI's better-studied moments
of design and use. Second, repair may embed modes of human interaction with technology
and with each other in ways that surface values as contingent and ongoing accomplishments,
suggesting ongoing processes of valuation that can never be fully fixed or commoditized.
These insights help HCI account for human relationships to technology built into the
world through repair.},

when seeking help from instructors, and 4) context-sensitive help embedded in a code

the effects of our intervention across two 2-week web development summer camps with

we found that a significant number of them (42.6%) had invested in learning programming
on the job. While many of these respondents wanted to perform traditional end-user
programming tasks (e.g., data analysis), we discovered that two top motivations for
learning programming were to improve the efficacy of technical conversations and to
acquire marketable skillsets. The main contribution of this work is in empirically
establishing the existence and characteristics of conversational programmers in a

corresponding field strengths. In our evaluation, we report an average accuracy of

signals and tracks the echoes of the finger at its microphones. To achieve sub-centimeter
level tracking accuracies, we present an innovative approach that use a modulation
technique commonly used in wireless communication called Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM). Our evaluation shows that fingerIO can achieve 2-D finger tracking
with an average accuracy of 8 mm using the in-built microphones and speaker of a Samsung
Galaxy S4. It also tracks subtle finger motion around the device, even when the phone
is in the pocket. Finally, we prototype a smart watch form-factor fingerIO device

side of the device and work even when it is fully occluded from the finger.},

abstract = {Thumb-to-fingers interfaces augment touch widgets on fingers, which are manipulated
by the thumb. Such interfaces are ideal for one-handed eyes-free input since touch
widgets on the fingers enable easy access by the stylus thumb. This study presents
DigitSpace, a thumb-to-fingers interface that addresses two ergonomic factors: hand
anatomy and touch precision. Hand anatomy restricts possible movements of a thumb,
which further influences the physical comfort during the interactions. Touch precision
is a human factor that determines how precisely users can manipulate touch widgets
set on fingers, which determines effective layouts of the widgets. Buttons and touchpads
were considered in our studies to enable discrete and continuous input in an eyes-free
manner. The first study explores the regions of fingers where the interactions can
be comfortably performed. According to the comfort regions, the second and third studies
explore effective layouts for button and touchpad widgets. The experimental results
indicate that participants could discriminate at least 16 buttons on their fingers.
For touchpad, participants were asked to perform unistrokes. Our results revealed
that since individual participant performed a coherent writing behavior, personalized
$1 recognizers could offer 92% accuracy on a cross-finger touchpad. A series of design
guidelines are proposed for designers, and a DigitSpace prototype that uses magnetic-tracking
methods is demonstrated.},

various aspects of HMPDs have been investigated, there is not enough information regarding
the effect of HMPDs (i.e., head referenced static and dynamic displays while a user
is in motion and standing) on visual attentional performance. For this purpose, we
conducted a user study (N=18) with three experimental conditions (control, standing,
walking) and two visual perceptual tasks (with dynamic and static displays). Significant
differences between conditions were only found for the task with dynamic display;
accuracy was lower in walking condition compared to the other two conditions. Our
work contributes an empirical investigation of the effect of HMPDs on visual attentional
performance by providing data-driven benchmarks for developing graphical user interface
design guidelines for HMPDs.},

systems. However, mobile support systems present a particular challenge: both the
camera and display are held by the user, leading to shaky video. When pointing or
drawing annotations, this means that the desired target often moves, causing the gesture
to lose its intended meaning. To address this problem, we investigate annotation stabilization
techniques, which allow annotations to stick to their intended location. We studied
two annotation systems, using three different forms of annotations, with both tablets
and head-mounted displays. Our analysis suggests that stabilized annotations and head-mounted
displays are only beneficial in certain situations. However, the simplest approach
of automatically freezing video while drawing annotations was surprisingly effective
in facilitating the completion of remote assistance tasks.},

to understand their own physical embodiment and spatial relationship with others in
complex situations. Our findings about patterns of viewing behavior and design implications

opportunity to add gaze information on the egocentric video. We hypothesized three
potential benefits of gaze-augmented egocentric video to support collaborative scenarios:
support deictic referencing, enable grounding in communication, and enable better
awareness of the collaborator's intentions. Previous research on using egocentric
videos for real-world collaborative tasks has failed to show clear benefits of gaze
point visualization. We designed a study, deconstructing a collaborative car navigation
scenario, to specifically target the value of gaze-augmented video for intention prediction.
Our results show that viewers of gaze-augmented video could predict the direction
taken by a driver at a four-way intersection more accurately and more confidently
than a viewer of the same video without the superimposed gaze point. Our study demonstrates
that gaze augmentation can be useful and encourages further study in real-world collaborative
scenarios.},

visualizations. We report on the design and implementation of Physikit, and present
a two-week field study which showed that participants got an increased sense of the

on finance and fiscal expenditure in such data makes invisible the in-kind effort
of volunteers and the wider beneficiaries of an organisation's work; and problems
arising from the interoperability of open data technologies. The paper concludes with

can support and enhance balancing techniques in sports, for example, by adjusting
players' level of intensity based on their heart rate. However, there is limited knowledge
on how to design such balancing and its impact on the user experience. To address
this we created two novel balancing techniques enabled by digitally augmenting a table
tennis table. We adjusted the more skilled player's performance by inducing two different
styles of play and studied the effects on game balancing and player engagement. We
showed that by altering the more skilled player's performance we can balance the game
through: (i) encouraging game mistakes, and (ii) changing the style of play to one
that is easier for the opponent to counteract. We outline the advantages and disadvantages
of each approach, extending our understanding of game balancing design. We also show
that digitally augmenting sports offers opportunities for novel balancing techniques
while facilitating engaging experiences, guiding those interested in HCI and sports.},

competitive and cooperative phases to help group members acquire group-wide awareness.

are no longer shielded from distractions. Therefore, we investigate the influence
of display transparency on task performance and background awareness in a dual-task
scenario. We conducted an experiment comparing transparent displays with conventional
displays in different horizontal and vertical configurations. Participants performed
an attention-demanding primary task on the display while simultaneously observing
the background for target stimuli. Our results show that transparent and horizontal

abstract = {While email provides numerous benefits in the workplace, it is unclear how patterns
of email use might affect key workplace indicators of productivity and stress. We
investigate how three email use patterns: duration, interruption habit, and batching,
relate to perceived workplace productivity and stress. We tracked email usage with
computer logging, biosensors and daily surveys for 40 information workers in their
in situ workplace environments for 12 workdays. We found that the longer daily time
spent on email, the lower was perceived productivity and the higher the measured stress.
People who primarily check email through self-interruptions report higher productivity
with longer email duration compared to those who rely on notifications. Batching email
is associated with higher rated productivity with longer email duration, but despite
widespread claims, we found no evidence that batching email leads to lower stress.
We discuss the implications of our results for improving organizational email practices.},

that they use their time ineffectively. To improve focus we designed meTime, a real-time
awareness application that shows users how they allocate their time across applications.
In two real-world deployments involving 118 participants, we examined whether greater
awareness of time use improves focus. In our first deployment, we provided awareness
information using meTime, to both office workers and students. Exposure to meTime
reduced use of social media, email, browsing and total time online. However increased
awareness didn't affect time spent in productivity applications. A second educational
deployment largely replicated these results and showed that meTime also reduced users'
perceptions of their ability to focus effectively. Changed perceptions were associated
with higher class grades. We discuss practical and theoretical implications as well
as design principles for use of time applications.},

multitasking. We explore instead how multitasking might be influenced by individual
factors: personality, stress, and sleep. Forty information workers' online activity
was tracked over two work weeks. The median duration of online screen focus was 40
seconds. The personality trait of Neuroticism was associated with shorter online focus
duration and Impulsivity-Urgency was associated with longer online focus duration.
Stress and sleep duration showed trends to be inversely associated with online focus.
Shorter focus duration was associated with lower assessed productivity at day's end.
Factor analysis revealed a factor of lack of control which significantly predicts
multitasking. Our results suggest that there could be a trait for distractibility
where some individuals are susceptible to online attention shifting in the workplace.
Our results have implications for information systems (e.g. educational systems, game
design) where attention focus is key.},

with them. The design of "assistive" technology often focuses on enhancing function;
however, we found that prostheses played important roles in people's development of
identity and sense of normalcy. Even when a prosthesis failed functionally, such as
was the case with 3D-printed prostheses created by an on-line open-source maker community
(e-NABLE), we found people still praised the design and initiative because of the
positive impacts on popular culture, identity, and community building. This work surfaces
crucial questions about the role of design interventions in identity production, the
promise of maker communities for accelerating innovation, and a broader definition
of "assistive" technology.},

these exercises when the researcher was not present. The results showed significant
levels of self-management and significant increases in functional measures with some

medical help when necessary as well as examining oneself in order to 'know' oneself

private, shameful and not to be talked about. In response to this, we designed Labella,
an augmented system that supports intimate bodily knowledge and pelvic fitness in
women. It combines a pair of underwear and a mobile phone as a tool for embodied intimate
self-discovery. In this paper, we describe Labella, and its evaluation with fourteen
women, aged 25-63. We show how through situated embodied perception Labella empowers 'looking'. We highlight how the simple act of augmented looking enables the construction
of knowledge which ranges from establishing the 'very basics' through to a nuanced
understanding of pelvic muscle structure. Finally, we highlight the role of awkwardness
and humour in the design of interactions to overcome taboo.},

in the other direction. In the experiment, the times for five IDs were predicted with
high precision from the measured time for one ID, thereby illustrating the effectiveness

pointing, a target is about to appear within a limited time window for selection.
Unlike in spatial pointing, there is no movement to control in the temporal domain;
the user can only determine when to launch the response. Although this task is common
in interactions requiring temporal precision, rhythm, or synchrony, no previous HCI
model predicts error rates as a function of task properties. Our model assumes that
users have an implicit point of aim but their ability to elicit the input event at
that time is hampered by variability in three processes: 1) an internal time-keeping
process, 2) a response-execution stage, and 3) input processing in the computer. We
derive a mathematical model with two parameters from these assumptions. High fit is
shown for user performance with two task types, including a rapidly paced game. The
model can explain previous findings showing that touchscreens are much worse in temporal
pointing than physical input devices. It also has novel implications for design that
extend beyond the conventional wisdom of minimising latency.},

abstract = {Mealtimes are a cherished part of everyday life around the world. Often centered on
family, friends, or special occasions, sharing meals is a practice embedded with traditions
and values. However, as mobile phone adoption becomes increasingly pervasive, tensions
emerge about how appropriate it is to use personal devices while sharing a meal with
others. Furthermore, while personal devices have been designed to support awareness
for the individual user (e.g., notifications), little is known about how to support
shared awareness in acceptability in social settings such as meals. In order to understand
attitudes about mobile phone use during shared mealtimes, we conducted an online survey
with 1,163 English-speaking participants. We find that attitudes about mobile phone
use at meals differ depending on the particular phone activity and on who at the meal
is engaged in that activity, children versus adults. We also show that three major
factors impact participants' attitudes: 1) their own mobile phone use; 2) their age;
and 3) whether a child is present at the meal. We discuss the potential for incorporating
social awareness features into mobile phone systems to ease tensions around conflicting
mealtime behaviors and attitudes.},

abstract = {The use of applications on mobile devices has changed dramatically over the past few
years. While web browsing was once a common activity, it's now reported that 86% of
time on mobile phones is in apps other than the browser. We set out to understand
how the mobile web was currently fitting into people's lives and what web sessions
looked like. Finding a dramatic reduction in mobile web revisi-tation rates compared
to previous work and that a large number of sessions comprised single page views,
we then studied how web content was shared with others in mobile messaging, the source
of many single page sessions. The HCI community has not heavily studied this sharing
activity that many people perform daily. We conclude with design implications for
new mobile applications from our two studies with a combined 287 participants where
we studied actual logs of mobile web use and link sharing behavior.},

users to choose from a plethora of mobile messaging applications. While we know a
lot about SMS practices, we know less about practices of messaging applications. In
this paper, we take a first step to explore one ubiquitous aspect of mobile messaging
-- messaging history. We designed, built, and trialled a mobile messaging application
without history named forget-me-not. The two-week trial showed that history-less messaging
no longer supports chit-chat as seen in e.g. WhatsApp, but is still considered conversational
and more 'engaging'. Participants expressed being lenient and relaxed about what they
wrote. Removing the history allowed us to gain insights into what uses history has
in other mobile messaging applications, such as planning events, allowing for distractions,
and maintaining multiple conversation threads.},

Using simple low-resolution capacitive touch sensors placed around a standard mobile
device and the built-in accelerometer, we demonstrate that errors can be predicted
at low error rates from micro-adjustments to hand grip and movement in the period
shortly after swiping the touchscreen. Specifically, when combining features derived
from hand grip and movement we obtain a mean AUC of 0.96 (with false accept and reject
rates both below 10%). Our results demonstrate that hand grip and movement provide
strong and low latency evidence for mistakes. The ability to detect user errors in
this way could be a valuable component in future interaction systems, allowing interfaces
to make it easier for users to correct erroneous inputs.},

complexity affected some touch interactions, primarily related to visual salience,

children and adults. We provide design recommendations that support the design of
touchscreen interfaces specifically tailored towards children of this age.},

touches. Second, we introduce Smart Touch, a novel template-matching technique for
touch input that maps any number of arbitrary contact-areas to a user's intended (x,y)
target location. The result is that users with motor impairments can touch however
their abilities allow, and Smart Touch will resolve their intended touch point. Smart
Touch therefore allows users to touch targets in whichever ways are most comfortable
and natural for them. In an experimental evaluation, we found that Smart Touch predicted
(x,y) coordinates of the users' intended target locations over three times closer
to the intended target than the native Land-on and Lift-off techniques reported by
the built-in touch sensors found in the Microsoft PixelSense interactive tabletop.
This result is an important step toward improving touch accuracy for people with motor
impairments and others for whom touch screen operation was previously impossible.},

we designed an experiment to systematically investigate the effect of spatial indirectness

In an abstract search task, participants of our study navigated a 2D space and were
asked to reproduce spatial item configurations in a recall task. Our results indicate
that spatial memory performance is not decreased by a spatial separation of touch
input gestures and visual display. Further, our results suggest that decreasing the

significantly higher typing rates and more comfortable interaction in experiments

sense of presence in virtual reality. However, scaling such experiences to support
multiple virtual objects is a challenge as each one needs to be accompanied with a
precisely-located haptic proxy object. We propose a solution that overcomes this limitation
by hacking human perception. We have created a framework for repurposing passive haptics,
called haptic retargeting, that leverages the dominance of vision when our senses
conflict. With haptic retargeting, a single physical prop can provide passive haptics
for multiple virtual objects. We introduce three approaches for dynamically aligning
physical and virtual objects: world manipulation, body manipulation and a hybrid technique
which combines both world and body manipulation. Our study results indicate that all
our haptic retargeting techniques improve the sense of presence when compared to typical
wand-based 3D control of virtual objects. Furthermore, our hybrid haptic retargeting
achieved the highest satisfaction and presence scores while limiting the visible side-effects
during interaction.},

the rays from an object, and a pair of them reconstructs the floating aerial image
of the object. Our system can optically copy adjacent environments based on this technology.
Haptic feedback is also given by using an airborne ultrasound tactile display (AUTD).
Converged ultrasound can give force feedback in midair. Based on the optical characteristics
of the MMAPs, the cloned image and the user share an identical coordinate system.
When a user touches the transferred clone image, the system gives force feedback so
that the user can feel the mechanical contact and reality of the floating image.},

emotional stability (the inverse of neuroticism) and several motivational affordances,

abstract = {Wall-sized displays support group work by allowing several people to work both separately
and together. However, whether people interact directly through touch input or indirectly
through mouse input can have profound effects on collaboration. We present a study
that compares how groups collaborate using either multitouch or multiple mice on a
wall-display. Participants used both input methods to work on two tasks: a shared-goal
task and a mixed-motive task. Results show differences in participants' awareness
in collaborative tasks between the two input methods. The results also help understand
the physical constraints touch input set on participants' control of actions in collaborative
tasks. We discuss how this influences collaboration. Results also show that touch
input did not promote more equal participation than mouse input. We contrast the findings
to earlier research on wall-display and tabletop collaboration.},

abstract = {There is a steadily growing interest in the design of spaces in which multiple interactive
surfaces are present and, in turn, in understanding their role in group activity.
However, authentic activities in these multi-surface spaces can be complex. Groups
commonly use digital and non-digital artefacts, tools and resources, in varied ways
depending on their specific social and epistemic goals. Thus, designing for collaboration
in such spaces can be very challenging. Importantly, there is still a lack of agreement
on how to approach the analysis of groups' experiences in these heterogeneous spaces.
This paper presents an actionable approach that aims to address the complexity of
understanding multi-user multi-surface systems. We provide a structure for applying
different analytical tools in terms of four closely related dimensions of user activity:
the setting, the tasks, the people and the runtime co-configuration. The applicability
of our approach is illustrated with six types of analysis of group activity in a multi-surface
design studio.},

to support co-located collaborative work. In this paper, we operationalize five collaborative
situations with increasing levels of coupling, and test the effects of providing shared
interaction support for a data manipulation task in each situation. The results show
the benefits of shared interaction for close collaboration: it encourages collaborative
manipulation, it is more efficient and preferred by users, and it reduces physical
navigation and fatigue. We also identify the time costs caused by disruption and communication
in loose collaboration and analyze the trade-offs between parallelization and close
collaboration. These findings inform the design of shared interaction techniques to
support collaboration on wall-sized displays.},

to support notetaking. First, our system integrates offline video analysis and online
gaze analysis to automatically detect and highlight key content from the lecture video
for notetaking. Second, our system provides adaptive video control that automatically
reduces the video playback speed or pauses it while a user is taking notes to minimize
the user's effort in controlling video. Our study shows that our system enables users
to take notes more easily and with better quality than the traditional video interface.},

methodology to infer which individuals could undergo transitions from mental health
discourse to suicidal ideation. We utilize semi-anonymous support communities on Reddit

and interactional measures for this purpose, as well as a propensity score matching
based statistical approach. Our approach allows us to derive distinct markers of shifts
to suicidal ideation. These markers can be modeled in a prediction framework to identify
individuals likely to engage in suicidal ideation in the future. We discuss societal

have to scan and memorize content before being able to analyze it. Even worse, any
update to the displayed content invalidates their spatial memory, which can force
them to manually rescan the entire display. Making display contents persist, we argue,
is thus the highest priority in designing a sensemaking system for the visually impaired.
We present a tactile display system designed with this goal in mind. The foundation
of our system is a large tactile display (140x100cm, 23x larger than Hyperbraille),
which we achieve by using a 3D printer to print raised lines of filament. The system's
software then trades in this space in order to minimize screen updates. Instead of
panning and zooming, for example, our system creates additional views, leaving display
contents intact and thus supporting users in preserving their spatial memory. We illustrate
our system and its design principles at the example of four spatial applications.
We evaluated our system with six blind users. Participants responded favorably to
the system and expressed, for example, that having multiple views at the same time
was helpful. They also judged the increased expressiveness of lines over the more
traditional dots as useful for encoding information.},

the user to precisely place Tangible Reels onto the table and create links between
them. During subsequent exploration, the device provides the names of the points and
lines that the user touches. A pre-study confirmed that Tangible Reels are stable

artifacts as it is about producing national identity, reputation, and economic gain.
Technology entrepreneurs take from and resist the discourse of their cities as emerging
sites of Silicon-Valley type innovation. They render the narrative of "catching up
with the west" overly simplistic, ahistorical and blind to situated practices of design.
This view, we argue, is critical for interrogating our views of design especially
as it becomes more central in the contemporary global economy.},

numbers of older adults are online, but little is known about their awareness of or
how they engage in mainstream crowd work. Through an online survey with 505 seniors,
we found that most have never heard of crowd work but would be motivated to complete
tasks by earning money or working on interesting or stimulating tasks. We follow up
results from the survey with interviews and observations of 14 older adults completing
crowd work tasks. While our survey data suggests that financial incentives are encouraging,
in-depth interviews reveal that a combination of personal and social incentives may
be stronger drivers of participation, but only if older adults can overcome accessibility
issues and understand the purpose of crowd work. This paper contributes insights into
how crowdsourcing sites could better engage seniors and other users.},

tasks are often interdependent, requiring a big picture view of the difference pieces
involved. Existing crowdsourcing approaches that support such tasks -- ranging from
Wikipedia to flash teams -- are bottlenecked by relying on a small number of individuals
to maintain the big picture. In this paper, we explore the idea that a computational
system can scaffold an emerging interdependent, big picture view entirely through
the small contributions of individuals, each of whom sees only a part of the whole.
To investigate the viability, strengths, and weaknesses of this approach we instantiate
the idea in a prototype system for accomplishing distributed information synthesis
and evaluate its output across a variety of topics. We also contribute a set of design
patterns that may be informative for other systems aimed at supporting big picture
thinking in small pieces.},

Based on 437 comments posted by crowd workers (Turkers) on the Amazon Mechanical Turk
(AMT) participation agreement, we identified work rejection as a major risk that Turkers
experience. Unfair rejections can result from poorly-designed tasks, unclear instructions,
technical errors, and malicious Requesters. Because the AMT policy and platform provide
little recourse to Turkers, they adopt strategies to minimize risk: avoiding new and
known bad Requesters, sharing information with other Turkers, and choosing low-risk
tasks. Through a series of ideas inspired by these findings-including notifying Turkers
and Requesters of a broken task, returning rejected work to Turkers for repair, and
providing collective dispute resolution mechanisms-we argue that making reducing risk
and building trust a first-class design goal can lead to solutions that improve outcomes
around rejected work for all parties in online labor markets.},

and interface components based on mass-spring analogy and combines the strengths of
both demonstration-based and declarative approaches. Also, gesture declaration is
done by specifying a mass-spring trajectory with planes in the acceleration space.
For iterative gesture modification, multi-level feedbacks are provided as well. The
results of evaluative studies have shown good usability and higher recognition performance
than that of dynamic time warping for simple gesture authoring. Later, we discuss
the benefits of applying a physical metaphor and hybrid approach.},

how to direct their input towards that system so that they do not also affect others

We present an interaction technique which uses multimodal feedback to help users address
in-air gesture systems. The feedback tells them how ("do that") and where ("there")
to gesture, using light, audio and tactile displays. By doing that there, users can
direct their input to the system they wish to interact with, in a place where their
gestures can be sensed. We discuss the design of our technique and three experiments
investigating its use, finding that users can "do that" well (93.2%-99.9%) while accurately
(51mm-80mm) and quickly (3.7s) finding "there".},

incorporated "seams,' visible hints disclosing aspects of automation operations, could
quickly develop theories. Users made plans that depended on their theories. We conclude
that foregrounding these automated processes may increase interface design complexity,

to follow. In the last decade, however, curation --- users sharing and promoting content
in a network --- has become a central social activity, as platforms like Facebook,
Twitter, Pinterest, and GitHub drive growth and engagement by connecting users through
content and content to users. While existing algorithms reward users that are highly
active with higher rankings, they fail to account for users' curatorial taste. This
paper introduces CuRank, an algorithm for ranking users and content in social networks
by explicitly modeling three characteristics of a good curator: discerning taste,
high activity, and timeliness. We evaluate CuRank on datasets from two popular social
networks --- GitHub and Vine --- and demonstrate its efficacy at ranking content and

on theories of information processing and procedural justice. In an online field experiment,
three levels of system transparency were tested in the high-stakes context of peer
assessment. Individuals whose expectations were violated (by receiving a lower grade
than expected) trusted the system less, unless the grading algorithm was made more
transparent through explanation. However, providing too much information eroded this
trust. Attitudes of individuals whose expectations were met did not vary with transparency.
Results are discussed in terms of a dual process model of attitude change and the
depth of justification of perceived inconsistency. Designing for trust requires balanced
interface transparency - not too little and not too much.},

by recommending people nearby to each other. Going beyond simple similarity and proximity
matching mechanisms, we explore a proposed framework of relational, social and personal
context as predictors of match opportunities to map out the design space of opportunistic
social matching systems. We contribute insights gained from a study combining Experience
Sampling Method (ESM) with 85 students of a U.S. university and interviews with 15
of these participants. A generalized linear mixed model analysis (n=1704) showed that
personal context (mood and busyness) as well as sociability of others nearby are the
strongest predictors of contextual match interest. Participant interviews suggest
operationalizing relational context using social network rarity and discoverable rarity,
and incorporating skill level and learning/teaching needs for activity partnering.
Based on these findings we propose passive context-awareness for opportunistic social
matching.},

abstract = {The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development of location-aware
technologies in a number of important domains. One such type of "unmapped" geographic
data is space usage rules (SURs), which are defined as geographically-bound activity
restrictions (e.g. "no dogs", "no smoking", "no fishing", "no skateboarding"). Researchers
in the area of human-computer interaction have recently begun to develop techniques
for the automated mapping of SURs with the aim of supporting activity planning systems
(e.g. one-touch "Can I Smoke Here?" apps, SUR-aware vacation planning tools). In this
paper, we present a novel SUR mapping technique -- SPtP -- that outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches by 30% for one of the most important components of the SUR mapping pipeline:
associating a point observation of a SUR (e.g. a 'no smoking' sign) with the corresponding
polygon in which the SUR applies (e.g. the nearby park or the entire campus on which
the sign is located). This paper also contributes a series of new SUR benchmark datasets
to help further research in this area.},

information and insights with each other. The challenge is to know when is the right
time to share what information without disrupting the present state of analysis. This
is crucial in ad-hoc sensemaking sessions with mobile devices because small screen
space limits information display. To address these tensions, we propose and evaluate
RAMPARTS - a spatially aware sensemaking system for collaborative crime analysis that
aims to support faster information sharing, clue-finding, and analysis. We compare
RAMPARTS to an interactive tabletop and a paper-based method in a controlled laboratory
study. We found that RAMPARTS significantly decreased task completion time compared
to paper, without affecting cognitive load or task completion time adversely compared
to an interactive tabletop. We conclude that designing for ad-hoc colocated sensemaking
on mobile devices could benefit from spatial awareness. In particular, spatial awareness
could be used to identify relevant information, support diverse alignment styles for
visual comparison, and enable alternative rhythms of sensemaking.},

incorporates high-level human objectives into the planning of flight trajectories.
An easy to use 3D design tool allows for quick specification and editing of trajectories
as well as for intuitive exploration of the resulting solution space. We demonstrate
the utility of our approach in several real-world application scenarios, including
aerial-videography, robotic light-painting and drone racing.},

have tens of or hundreds of photographs, they must enhance each photo one by one by
manually tweaking sliders in software such as brightness and contrast, because automatic
color enhancement is not always satisfactory for them. To support this repetitive
manual task, we present self-reinforcing color enhancement, where the system implicitly
and progressively learns the user's preferences by training on their photo editing
history. The more photos the user enhances, the more effectively the system supports
the user. We present a working prototype system called SelPh, and then describe the
algorithms used to perform the self-reinforcement. We conduct a user study to investigate
how photographers would use a self-reinforcing system to enhance a collection of photos.
The results indicate that the participants were satisfied with the proposed system
and strongly agreed that the self-reinforcing approach is preferable to the traditional
workflow.},

has multiple challenges of which we address four: The continuous dynamic development
of experiences; the multiplicity and complexity involved; the distinction between
"real" and "virtual" experiences, and finally applying descriptive concepts predictively.
Based on our background in activity theoretical HCI we discuss two cases to nuance
the discussion of conceptual blends and HCI. We provide an understanding of conceptual
blends beyond one-to-one static blends, and immediately recognizable concepts. We
focus on multiplicity, dynamics and learning, and in that we provide a more advanced
methodological scaffolding of analyses of conceptual blends, hence we propose that
designers need to seed blends in design.},
