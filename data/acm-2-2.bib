abstract = {Individuals with cognitive impairments currently leverage extensive human resources
during their transitions from assisted living to independent living. In Western Europe,
many government-supported volunteer organizations provide sheltered living facilities;
supervised environments in which people with cognitive impairments collaboratively
learn daily living skills. In this paper, we describe communal cooking practices in
sheltered living facilities and identify opportunities for supporting these with interactive
technology to reduce volunteer workload. We conducted two contextual observations
of twelve people with cognitive impairments cooking in sheltered living facilities
and supplemented this data through interviews with four employees and volunteers who
supervise them. Through thematic analysis, we identified four themes to inform design
requirements for communal cooking activities: Work organization, community, supervision,
and practicalities. Based on these, we present five design implications for assistive
systems in kitchens for people with cognitive deficiencies.},

abstract = {Continuous 'pseudocolor' maps visualize how a quantitative attribute varies smoothly
over space. These maps are widely used by experts and lay citizens alike for communicating
scientific and geographical data. A critical challenge for designers of these maps
is selecting a color scheme that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. Although
there exist empirically grounded guidelines for color choice in segmented maps (e.g.,
choropleths), continuous maps are significantly understudies, and their color-coding
guidelines are largely based on expert opinion and design heuristics--many of these
guidelines have yet to be verified experimentally. We conducted a series of crowdsourced
experiments to investigate how the perception of continuous maps is affected by colormap
characteristics and spatial frequency (a measure of data complexity). We find that
spatial frequency significantly impacts the effectiveness of color encodes, but the
precise effect is task-dependent. While rainbow schemes afforded the highest accuracy
in quantity estimation irrespective of spatial complexity, divergent colormaps significantly
outperformed other schemes in tasks requiring the perception of high-frequency patterns.
We interpret these results in relation to current practices, and devise new and more
granular guidelines for color mapping in continuous maps.},

where they are located. Through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate Wall++ can

poorly against photos taken from front-facing cameras. We discuss how these findings
impact mobile applications that leverage face and eye detection, and derive practical

on non-Western future technology designers. Our lens was a course designed to engage
Egyptian students with a local yet culturally-distant community to design applications
for documenting intangible heritage. Through an action research, the instructors reflect
on selected students' activities. Despite deploying a flexible learning curriculum
that encourages greater autonomy, the students perceived themselves with less agency
than other institutional stakeholders involved in the project. Further, some of them
struggled to empathize with the community as the impact of the cultural differences
on configuring participation was profound. We discuss the implications of the findings
on HCI education and in international cross-cultural design projects.},

compact, high-resolution (7 mm pitch), mobile tabletop shape display. shapeShift can
be mounted on passive rollers allowing for bimanual interaction where the user can
freely manipulate the system while it renders spatially relevant content. shapeShift
can also be mounted on an omnidirectional-robot to provide both vertical and lateral
kinesthetic feedback, display moving objects, or act as an encountered-type haptic
device for VR. We present a study on haptic search tasks comparing spatial manipulation
of a shape display for egocentric exploration of a map versus exploration using a
fixed display and a touch pad. Results show a 30% decrease in navigation path lengths,
24% decrease in task time, 15% decrease in mental demand and 29% decrease in frustration

direction is to combine the two approaches for high quality, low latency, and low

assistant built to automate itself over time by (i) allowing new chatbots to be easily
integrated to automate more scenarios, (ii) reusing prior crowd answers, and (iii)
learning to automatically approve response candidates. Our 5-month-long deployment
with 80 participants and 281 conversations shows that Evorus can automate itself without
compromising conversation quality. Crowd-AI architectures have long been proposed
as a way to reduce cost and latency for crowd-powered systems; Evorus demonstrates
how automation can be introduced successfully in a deployed system. Its architecture
allows future researchers to make further innovation on the underlying automated components

real-life use of the interfaces, evaluating (1) people's appraisal of three types
of social information and (2) the influence of an interaction style on coordination
of shared use. The results disclose relations between the interface and the amount
of verbal communication, consideration, and accountability. With this work, we urge
the need for interaction designers to consider shared use.},

funds, thus encountering choice overload, typical of many online environments. Users
were rewarded for positive investment returns. To overcome choice overload, users
could sort the alternatives based on product attributes (fees, category, fund name,
past performance). To elicit their demand for sorting, the experimental design enabled
users to forgo 0%-9% of their reward in return for activating the sorting feature.
The elicited downward sloping demand curve suggests a curvilinear relationship between
sorting use and cost. More broadly, the study offers a way to quantify user demand

suggest that researchers can better capture gender in a way that 1) addresses gender
variation without othering or erasing non-binary respondents; and 2) minimizes "trolls'"
opportunity to use surveys as a mischief platform. The analyses of these two distinct

PA tracking was impacted by caregivers' attitudes toward safety, which were influenced
by how they perceived social connections within their neighborhoods; and cognitive-emotional
processes. We conclude that PA tracking tools for low-SES families should help caregivers
and children to experience and celebrate progress.},

in their ability to provide rapid access to large and diverse participant samples.
As a result, several researchers have conducted studies investigating the similarities
and differences between data collected through crowdsourcing and more traditional,
laboratory-style data collection. We add to this body of research by examining the
feasibility of conducting social acceptability studies via crowdsourcing. Social acceptability
can be a key determinant for the early adoption of emerging technologies, and as such,
we focus our investigation on social acceptability for Head-Worn Display (HWD) input
modalities. Our results indicate that data collected via a crowdsourced experiment
and a laboratory-style setting did not differ at a statistically significant level.
These results provide initial support for crowdsourcing platforms as viable options
for conducting social acceptability research.},

is known to be an effective preparation strategy, yet some students lack motivation
to engage or persist in self-testing activities. Adding game elements to a platform
supporting self-testing may increase engagement and, by extension, exam performance.
We conduct a randomized controlled experiment (n=701) comparing the effect of two
game elements -- a points system and a badge system -- used individually and in combination.
We find that the badge system elicits significantly higher levels of voluntary self-testing
activity and this effect is particularly pronounced amongst a relatively small cohort.
Importantly, this increased activity translates to a significant improvement in exam
scores. Our data supports a causal relationship between gamification and learning
outcomes, mediated by self-testing behavior. This provides empirical support for Landers'
theory of gamified learning when the gamified activity is conducted prior to measuring
learning outcomes.},

demonstrate that any of the methods presented may be practically used to encode a

database), making human-designable visual markers practical for applications such

We studied the impact of real-time feedback on planning annotations, specifically
two different annotation types, in a custom-built, third-person, multiplayer game

use. We found that annotations helped engage players in collaborative planning, which
reduced frustration, and shortened goal completion times. Based on these findings,
we discuss how annotating in virtual game spaces enables collaborative planning and

is hard. It requires expertise in both capturing and editing footage. While hiring
a professional videographer is possible, this is too costly for most casual events.
An alternative is to place 360 video cameras around an event space to capture footage
passively and then extract regular field-of-view (RFOV) shots for the summary. This
paper focuses on the problem of extracting such RFOV shots. Since we cannot actively
control the cameras or the scene, it is hard to create "ideal' shots that adhere strictly
to traditional cinematography rules. To better understand the tradeoffs, we study
human preferences for static and moving camera RFOV shots generated from 360 footage.
From the findings, we derive design guidelines. As a secondary contribution, we use
these guidelines to develop automatic algorithms that we demonstrate in a prototype
user interface for extracting RFOV shots from 360 videos.},

people to have access to personal information, which significantly reduces the personal
privacy of those whose data is stored and increases risk of identity theft, data leaks,
or social engineering attacks. Our research studies the tradeoffs between privacy
and utility of personal information for human decision making. Using a record-linkage
scenario, this paper presents a controlled study of how varying degrees of information
availability influences the ability to effectively use personal information. We compared
the quality of human decision-making using a visual interface that controls the amount
of personal information available using visual markup to highlight data discrepancies.
With this interface, study participants who viewed only 30% of data content had decision
quality similar to those who had full 100% access. The results demonstrate that it
is possible to greatly limit the amount of personal information available to human
decision makers without negatively affecting utility or human effectiveness. However,
the findings also show there is a limit to how much data can be hidden before negatively
influencing the quality of judgment in decisions involving person-level data. Despite
the reduced accuracy with extreme data hiding, the study demonstrates that with proper
interface designs, many correct decisions can be made with even legally de-identified
data that is fully masked (74.5% accuracy with fully-masked data compared to 84.1%
with full access). Thus, when legal requirements only allow for de-identified data
access, use of well-designed interface can significantly improve data utility.},

of the impact of the overall sensory experience and that audio dimensionality in VR
may not be a significant factor contributing to PX. Based on our findings and observations,
we provide five design guidelines for VR games.},

enrollments, but remain limited by their rigid, predetermined curricula. To overcome
this limitation, this paper contributes a visual recommender system called MOOCex.
The system recommends lecture videos across different courses by considering both
video contents and sequential inter-topic relationships mined from course syllabi;
and more importantly, it allows for interactive visual exploration of the semantic
space of recommendations within a learner's current context. When compared to traditional
methods (e.g., content-based recommendation and ranked list representations), MOOCex
suggests videos from more diverse perspectives and helps learners make better video
playback decisions. Further, feedback from MOOC learners and instructors indicates
that the system enhances both learning and teaching effectiveness.},

abstract = {An individual's trust propensity - i.e., a dispositional willingness to rely on others"
- mediates multiple socio-technical systems and has implications for their personal,
and societal, well-being. Hence, understanding and modeling an individual's trust
propensity is important for human-centered computing research. Conventional methods
for understanding trust propensities have been surveys and lab experiments. We propose
a new approach to model trust propensity based on long-term phone use metadata that
aims to complement typical survey approaches with a lower-cost, faster, and scalable
alternative. Based on analysis of data from a 10-week field study (mobile phone logs)
and "ground truth" survey involving 50 participants, we: (1) identify multiple associations
between phone-based social behavior and trust propensity; (2) define a machine learning
model that automatically infers a person's trust propensity. The results pave way
for understanding trust at a societal scale and have implications for personalized
applications in the emerging social internet of things.},

abstract = {Talk therapy is a common, effective, and desirable form of mental health treatment.
Yet, it is inaccessible to many people. Enabling peers to chat online using effective
principles of talk therapy could help scale this form of mental health care. To understand
how such chats could be designed, we conducted a two-week field experiment with 40
people experiencing mental illnesses comparing two types of online chats-chats guided
by prompts, and unguided chats. Results show that anxiety was significantly reduced
from pre-test to post-test. User feedback revealed that guided chats provided solutions
to problems and new perspectives, and were perceived as "deep," while unguided chats
offered personal connection on shared experiences and were experienced as "smooth."
We contribute the design of an online guided chat tool and insights into the design
of peer support chat systems that guide users to initiate, maintain, and reciprocate
emotional support.},

data-driven workplace. We conducted an observation-based qualitative study of how
electricians in an electrical company interact with data related to their work accountability,
which comprises the information employees feel is reasonable to share and document
about their work. The electricians we studied capture data both manually, recording
the hours spent on a particular task, and automatically, as their mobile devices regularly
track data such as location. First, our results demonstrate how work accountability
manifests for employees' manual labor work that has become data-driven. We show how
employees work through moments of transparency, privacy, and accountability using
data focused on location, identification and time. Second, we demonstrate how this
data production is interdependent with employees' beliefs about what is a reasonable
level of detail and transparency to provide about their work. Lastly, we articulate
specific design implications related to work accountability.},

HCI to engage in human-food interaction. Extending existing foci of health and environmental
sustainability, food democracy requires thinking through aspects of social and economic
justice, and democratic governance as directions for the study and design of technologies
for alternative food movements. To exemplify food democracy, we report on field observations
and interviews about the opportunities and challenges for supporting the development
of local food networks with communities in deprived neighbourhoods using an online
direct food marketing platform. Using a food democracy framing, we identify tensions
around environmental, social, and economic goals; challenges of local food businesses
operating within the existing economic paradigm; and differing perspectives on ownership
and governance in the network. We discuss the need for HCI to design for systems change
and propose a design space for HCI in supporting food democracy movements.},

participants were asked to suggest foot gestures to actions (referents) in three conditions:
standing up in front of a large display, sitting down in front of a desktop display,
and standing on a projected surface. Based on majority count and agreement scores,
we identified three gesture sets, one for each condition. Each gesture set shows a
mapping between a common action and its chosen gesture. As a further contribution,
we suggest a new measure called specification score, which indicates the degree to
which a gesture is specific, preferable and intuitive to an action in a specific condition
of use. Finally, we present measurable insights that can be implemented as guidelines
for future development and research of foot interaction.},

abstract = {We present metamaterial textures---3D printed surface geometries that can perform
a controlled transition between two or more textures. Metamaterial textures are integrated
into 3D printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment
and the user's tactile sense. Inspired by foldable paper sheets ("origami") and surface
wrinkling, our 3D printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold
when compressed by an external global force. Unlike origami, however, metamaterial
textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and
sequence of actuation. This allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them
useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. Metamaterial
textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed,
or stood on. This allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from
flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually
impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. We present an editor assists users
in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces,
and previewing their deformation.},

designs in various countries. We contribute the first large-scale analysis of 80,901
website designs across 44 countries, made available via an interactive web-based design
catalog. Using computational image metrics to compare the ~2,000 most visited websites
per country, we found significant differences between several design aspects, such
as a website's colorfulness, visual complexity, the number of text areas and the average
saturation of colors. Our results contribute a snapshot of web designs that users
in 44 countries frequently see, showing that the design of websites with a global
reach are more homogenized compared to local websites between countries.},
