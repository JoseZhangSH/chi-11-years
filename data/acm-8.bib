individual works, was designed and coded primarily by women to meet the needs of the
online fandom community. Their design decisions were informed by existing values and
norms around issues such as accessibility, inclusivity, and identity. We conducted
interviews with 28 users and developers, and with this data we detail the history
and design of AO3 using the framework of feminist HCI and focusing on the successful
incorporation of values into design. We conclude with considering examples of complexity
in values in design work: the use of design to mitigate tensions in values and to
influence value formation or change.},

potentially critical factor has mostly been overlooked -- software itself. To help
close this gap, we recently created GenderMag, a systematic inspection method to enable
software practitioners to evaluate their software for issues of gender-inclusiveness.
In this paper, we present the first real-world investigation of software practitioners'
ability to identify gender-inclusiveness issues in software they create/maintain using
this method. Our investigation was a multiple-case field study of software teams at
three major U.S. technology organizations. The results were that, using GenderMag
to evaluate software, these software practitioners identified a surprisingly high
number of gender-inclusiveness issues: 25% of the software features they evaluated
had gender-inclusiveness issues.},

comparison of five different training strategies. For complex web search challenges,
we show that providing expert examples is an effective form of training, surpassing
other forms of training in nearly all measures of interest. However, such training
relies on access to domain expertise, which may be expensive or lacking. Therefore,
in a second experiment we study the feasibility of training workers in the absence
of domain expertise. We show that having workers validate the work of their peer workers
can be even more effective than having them review expert examples if we only present
solutions filtered by a threshold length. The results suggest that crowdsourced solutions
of peer workers may be harnessed in an automated training pipeline.},

approaches to facilitating continuous observational learning in crowdsourcing communities.
In a study conducted with workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we asked workers to complete
a set of tasks identifying nutritional composition of different meals. We examined
workers' accuracy gains after being exposed to expert-generated feedback and to two
types of peer-generated feedback: direct accuracy assessment with explanations of
errors, and a comparison with solutions generated by other workers. The study further
confirmed that expert-generated feedback is a powerful mechanism for facilitating
learning and leads to significant gains in accuracy. However, the study also showed
that comparing one's own solutions with a variety of solutions suggested by others
and their comparative frequencies leads to significant gains in accuracy. This solution
is particularly attractive because of its low cost, minimal impact on time and cost
of job completion, and high potential for adoption by a variety of crowdsourcing platforms.},

threshold to skill development by repurposing existing tasks on the marketplace as
mentored, paid, real-world work experiences, which we refer to as micro-internships.
We instantiate this idea in Atelier, a micro-internship platform that connects crowd
interns with crowd mentors. Atelier guides mentor-intern pairs to break down expert
crowdsourcing tasks into milestones, review intermediate output, and problem-solve
together. We conducted a field experiment comparing Atelier's mentorship model to
a non-mentored alternative on a real-world programming crowdsourcing task, finding
that Atelier helped interns maintain forward progress and absorb best practices.},

Because each microtask can be completed individually with limited awareness of what
has been already done and what others are doing, this decomposition can change the
experience of collaborative writing. Prior work has used microtasking to support collaborative
writing with unaffiliated crowd workers. To instead study its impact on collaboration
among writers with context and investment in the writing project, we asked six groups
of co-workers (or 19 people in total) to use the MicroWriter in a synchronous, collocated
setting to write a report about a shared work goal. Our observations suggest ways
that recent advances in microtasking and crowd work can be used to support collaborative
writing within preexisting groups.},

conversion techniques and a second stage provides added incentive for players to reach
higher exertion levels. A study of 18 participants found that the resulting games
support anti-sedentary levels of exertion while falling slightly below national recommendations
for cardiovascular exercise. Adding exercise to the games did not affect players'

a survey of situational lighting conditions, verified our test in a lab study, and

We then created ColorCheck, an image-processing tool that shows designers the proportion

research suggests people generate better ideas if they see abstracted solution paths

than being inundated with all prior ideas. Automated and semi-automated methods can
also offer interpretations of earlier ideas. To benefit from sensemaking in practice
with limited resources, ideation platform developers need to weigh the cost-quality
tradeoffs of different methods for surfacing solution paths. To explore this, we conducted
an online study where 245 participants generated ideas for two problems in one of
five conditions: 1) no stimuli, 2) exposure to all prior ideas, or solution paths
extracted from prior ideas using 3) a fully automated workflow, 4) a hybrid human-machine
approach, and 5) a fully manual approach. Contrary to expectations, human-generated
paths did not improve ideation (as meas-ured by fluency and breadth of ideation) over
simply showing all ideas. Machine-generated paths sometimes significantly improved
fluency and breadth of ideation over no ideas (although at some cost to idea quality).
These findings suggest that automated sensemaking can improve idea generation, but
we need more research to understand the value of human sensemaking for crowd ideation.},

sketches show a prevalent use of metaphors, say, for communicating volume though big-is-on
and small-is-off, as well as a lack of conventions. Furthermore, the affordances used
were curiously asymmetrical compared to those offered by non-shape-changing interfaces.

to implement these variations, it is unclear what affordance they provide, how users
understand their relation to the underlying system state, and how feedback via shape
change is perceived. We investigated this by studying how 15 participants perceived
and used 13 shape-changing buttons. The buttons covered several aspects of affordance,
system state, and feedback, including invite-to-touch movements, two styles of transition
animation, and two actuation technologies. Participants explored and interacted with
the buttons while thinking aloud. The results show that affordances are hard to communicate
clearly with shape change; while some movements invited actions, others were seen
as a malfunction. The best clue as to button state was provided by the position of
the button in combination with vibration. Linear transition animation for changes
in button state was the best received form of shape-change feedback. We discuss also
how these findings can inform the design of shape-changing interfaces more generally.},

in response to direct manipulation. As a proof-of-concept prototype, we developed
preliminary physics algorithms running on pin-based shape displays. The system can
create computationally variable properties of deformable materials that are visually
and physically perceivable. In our experiments, users identify three deformable material
properties (flexibility, elasticity and viscosity) through direct touch interaction
with the shape display and its dynamic movements. In this paper, we describe interaction
techniques, our implementation, future applications and evaluation on how users differentiate
between specific properties of our system. Our research shows that shape changing
interfaces can go beyond simply displaying shape allowing for rich embodied interaction
and perceptions of rendered materials with the hands and body.},

differing default levels of cognitive construal. Two initial randomized experiments
revealed that individuals who completed the same information processing task on a
digital mobile device (a tablet or laptop computer) versus a non-digital platform
(a physical print-out) exhibited a lower level of construal, one prioritizing immediate,
concrete details over abstract, decontextualized interpretations. This pattern emerged
both in digital platform participants' greater preference for concrete versus abstract
descriptions of behaviors as well as superior performance on detail-focused items
(and inferior performance on inference-focused items) on a reading comprehension assessment.
A pair of final studies found that the likelihood of correctly solving a problem-solving
task requiring higher-level "gist" processing was: (1) higher for participants who
processed the information for task on a non-digital versus digital platform and (2)
heightened for digital platform participants who had first completed an activity activating
an abstract mindset, compared to (equivalent) performance levels exhibited by participants
who had either completed no prior activity or completed an activity activating a concrete
mindset.},

to design well-functioning driver support systems for them, in order to reduce the
number of accidents. Despite the fact that the growing markets can be found in Asia,
most advisory traffic information systems (ATIS) are designed for, and adapted to,
the western market, and its predominant traffic safety cultures (TSCs). However, traffic
safety cultures differ between different parts of the world, and this in turn affects
how drivers respond to advisory traffic information. In our study, we designed an
ATIS to accommodate two different traffic safety cultures. Our findings show that
although drivers belonging to both TSCs drove more safely with our ATIS than without,
they still responded very differently to it, using it to support their different driving
strategies. This implies that the traffic safety culture of the driver cannot be ignored;
ATIS designers need to study and understand the TSC they are designing for.},

be conveyed through action, is a vital aspect of many human interactions. For instance,
paint on canvas is said to be an expressive medium, because it affords the artist
the ability to convey multifaceted emotional intent through intricate manipulations
of a brush. To date, touch devices have failed to offer users a level of expressiveness
in their interactions that rivals that experienced by the painter and those completing
other skilled physical tasks. We investigate how data about hand movement -- provided
by a motion sensor, similar to those found in many smart watches or fitness trackers
-- can be used to expand the expressiveness of touch interactions. We begin by introducing
a conceptual model that formalizes a design space of possible expressive touch interactions.
We then describe and evaluate Expressy, an approach that uses a wrist-worn inertial
measurement unit to detect and classify qualities of touch interaction that extend
beyond those offered by today's typical sensing hardware. We conclude by describing
a number of sample applications, which demonstrate the enhanced, expressive interaction
capabilities made possible by Expressy.},

We investigate two indirect-touch techniques combined with direct pen input: the first
redirects touches to the user's gaze position, and the second redirects touches to
the pen position. In this paper, we present an empirical user study where we compare
both partially-indirect techniques to direct pen and touch input in bimanual pan,
zoom, and ink tasks. Our experimental results show that users are comparatively fast
with the indirect techniques, but more accurate as users can dynamically change the
zoom-target during indirect zoom gestures. Further our studies reveal that direct
and indirect zoom gestures have distinct characteristics regarding spatial use, gestural
use, and bimanual parallelism.},

to the display. We explore this emerging pre-touch modality via a self-capacitance
touchscreen that can sense multiple fingers above a mobile device, as well as grip
around the screen's edges. This capability opens up many possibilities for mobile
interaction. For example, using pre-touch in an anticipatory role affords an "ad-lib
interface" that fades in a different UI--appropriate to the context--as the user approaches
one-handed with a thumb, two-handed with an index finger, or even with a pinch or
two thumbs. Or we can interpret pre-touch in a retroactive manner that leverages the
approach trajectory to discern whether the user made contact with a ballistic vs.
a finely-targeted motion. Pre-touch also enables hybrid touch + hover gestures, such
as selecting an icon with the thumb while bringing a second finger into range to invoke
a context menu at a convenient location. Collectively these techniques illustrate
how pre-touch sensing offers an intriguing new back-channel for mobile interaction.},

navigating identity crises. We find that they use ICTs to develop identity awareness-that
is, they connect with a human infrastructure through which they can develop a "big

posthumous messaging services have the potential to alter the relationship between

points for further research. Our work extends the growing body of research that is

to provide unique emotional, sometimes uncomfortable experiences is growing. Yet there

in terms of the feelings and thoughts they evoked, different PX constructs, as well
as game-related and personal factors contributing to these. We found that most players
enjoyed and appreciated experiencing negatively valenced emotions, such as sadness.
Emotions were evoked by a variety of interactive and non-interactive game aspects,
such as in-game loss, character attachment and (lack of) agency, but also personal
memories, and were often accompanied by (self-)reflection. Our findings highlight
the potential of games to provide emotionally rewarding and thought-provoking experiences,
as well as outline opportunities for future research and design of such experiences.
They also showcase that negative affect may contribute to enjoyment, thereby extending
our notion of positive player experience.},

investigate the effects of social exclusion in the context of a multiplayer game,
we developed and validated a social exclusion paradigm that we embedded in an online
game. Called Operator Challenge, our paradigm influenced feelings of social exclusion
and access to hostile cognitions (measured through a word-completion task). In addition,
the degree of experienced belonging predicted player enjoyment, effort, and the number
of hostile words completed; however, the experience measures did not mediate the relationship
between belonging and access to hostile cognitions. Our work facilitates understanding
the causes and effects of exclusion, which is important for the study of player experience

follow-up questions; (3) helping patients make sense of medical information and treatment
actions; (4) offering patient control over the process pace and what situations to

abstract = {Microtasks are small units of work designed to be completed individually, eventually
contributing to a larger goal. Although microtasks can be performed in isolation,
in practice people often complete a chain of microtasks within a single session. Through
a series of crowd-based studies, we look at how various microtasks can be chained
together to improve efficiency and minimize mental demand, focusing on the writing
domain. We find that participants completed low-complexity microtasks faster when
they were preceded by the same type of microtask, whereas they found high-complexity
microtasks less mentally demanding when pre-ceded by microtasks on the same content.
Furthermore, participants were faster at starting high-complexity microtasks after
completing lower-complexity microtasks, but completion time and quality were not affected.
These findings provide insight into how microtasks can be ordered to optimize transitions
from one microtask to another.},

abstract = {Microtask platforms are becoming commonplace tools for performing human research,
producing gold-standard data, and annotating large datasets. These platforms connect
requesters (researchers or companies) with large populations (crowds) of workers,
who perform small tasks, typically taking less than five minutes each. A topic of
ongoing research concerns the design of tasks that elicit high quality annotations.
Here we identify a seemingly banal feature of nearly all crowdsourcing workflows that
profoundly impacts workers' responses. Microtask assignments typically consist of
a sequence of tasks sharing a common format (e.g., circle galaxies in an image). Using
image-labeling, a canonical microtask format, we show that earlier tasks can have
a strong influence on responses to later tasks, shifting the distribution of future
responses by 30-50% (total variational distance). Specifically, prior tasks influence
the content that workers focus on, as well as the richness and specialization of responses.
We call this phenomenon intertask effects. We compare intertask effects to framing,
effected by stating the requester's research interest, and find that intertask effects
are on par or stronger. If uncontrolled, intertask effects could be a source of systematic
bias, but our results suggest that, with appropriate task design, they might be leveraged
to hone worker focus and acuity, helping to elicit reproducible, expert-level judgments.
Intertask effects are a crucial aspect of human computation that should be considered
in the design of any crowdsourced study.},

learning, but existing crowdsourcing schemes are too expensive to scale up with the
expanding volume of data. To scale and widen the applicability of crowdsourcing, we
present a technique that produces extremely rapid judgments for binary and categorical
labels. Rather than punishing all errors, which causes workers to proceed slowly and
deliberately, our technique speeds up workers' judgments to the point where errors
are acceptable and even expected. We demonstrate that it is possible to rectify these
errors by randomizing task order and modeling response latency. We evaluate our technique
on a breadth of common labeling tasks such as image verification, word similarity,
sentiment analysis and topic classification. Where prior work typically achieves a
0.25x to 1x speedup over fixed majority vote, our approach often achieves an order
of magnitude (10x) speedup.},

knowledge for clustering complex information. However, existing approaches have difficulties
supporting the global context needed for workers to generate meaningful categories,
and are costly because all items require human judgments. We introduce Alloy, a hybrid
approach that combines the richness of human judgments with the power of machine algorithms.
Alloy supports greater global context through a new "sample and search" crowd pattern
which changes the crowd's task from classifying a fixed subset of items to actively
sampling and querying the entire dataset. It also improves efficiency through a two
phase process in which crowds provide examples to help a machine cluster the head
of the distribution, then classify low-confidence examples in the tail. To accomplish
this, Alloy introduces a modular "cast and gather" approach which leverages a machine
learning backbone to stitch together different types of judgment tasks.},

respondents to provide two contrasting software update stories. Using content analysis
we analysed the stories and found that users go through six stages while updating:
awareness, deciding to update, preparation, installation, troubleshooting, and post
state. We further detail the issues respondents experienced during each stage and
the impact on their willingness to update.},

To study whether improved interaction design could affect unit testing and documentation

Vesta's interaction design is that developers frequently manually test the software
they are building. We propose leveraging runtime information from these manual executions.
Because developers naturally exercise the part of the code on which they are currently
working, this information will be highly relevant to appropriate documentation and
testing tasks. In a complex coding task, nearly all documentation created using Vesta
was accurate, compared to only 60% of documentation created without Vesta, and Vesta
was able to generate significant portions of all tests, even those written manually
by developers without Vesta.},

no direct interference, combining them provides benefits such as multi-resolution
haptic images and a synergistic effect on haptic perception. We conducted user studies

The results showed that the acoustic field affects the tactile perception of the laser
haptics. We explored augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications such as
providing haptic feedback of the combination of these two methods. We believe that
the results of this study contribute to the exploration of laser haptic displays and
expand the expression of aerial haptic displays based on other principles.},

Moreover, it is unclear how much the user--s current physical activity may interfere

and evaluation of ActiVibe, a set of vibrotactile icons designed to represent progress
through the values 1 to 10. We demonstrate a recognition rate of over 96% in a laboratory
setting using a commercial smartwatch. ActiVibe was also evaluated in situ with 22

muscles on a sleeve to create a pulling sensation that can guide the forearm's pronation

of stepper motors to provide pulling force, fishing lines and elastic bands to imitate
muscle contraction to drive the forearm to rotate instinctively. We present two preliminary
experiments. The first one shows that this system can effectively guide the forearm
to rotate in the correct direction. The second one shows that users can be guided
to the targeted angle by utilizing a tactile cue. We also report users' feedback through

We discovered that longer lockouts induced workers to switch to other activities.

their current activity. Designers rely on a range of UI elements and visual techniques
to present the new content to users, such as pop-ups, message icons, and marquees.
Web designers need to select which technique to use depending on the centrality of
the information and how quickly they need a reaction. However, designers often rely
on intuition and anecdotes rather than empirical evidence to drive their decision-making
as to which presentation technique to use. This work represents an attempt to quantify
these presentation style decisions. We present a large (n=1505) user study that compares
15 visual attention-grabbing techniques with respect to reaction time, noticeability,
annoyance, likability, and recall. We suggest glowing shadows and message icons with
badges, as well as more possibilities for future work.},

the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and the 2015 UK general election. We extend
previous HCI literature on the growing use of social media in a political context
and contribute specifically on understanding the emergent use of visual media by citizens
when engaging with political issues and democratic process. Through a qualitative
analysis of images shared on the platform Instagram, we demonstrate that the Scottish
electorate did indeed used image-sharing for political self-expression -- posting
a variety of visual content, representative of a diversity of political opinion. We
conclude that users utilised Instagram as a platform to craft and present their "political
selves". We raise questions for future research around power and inequality on such
platforms as well as their capability of providing a persistent forum for debate.},

Snowden. We demonstrate how behavioral differences of opinion groups can distort the
presence of opinions on a social media platform. By studying the differences between
a numerical minority (anti-Snowden) and a majority (pro-Snowden) group, we found that
the minority group engaged in a "shared audiencing" practice with more persistent
production of original tweets, focusing increasingly on inter-personal interactions
with like-minded others. The majority group engaged in a "gatewatching" practice by
disseminating information from the group, and over time shifted further from making
original comments to retweeting others'. The findings show consistency with previous
social science research on how social environment shapes majority and minority group
behaviors. We also highlight that they can be further distorted by the collective
use of social media design features such as the "retweet" button, by introducing the
concept of "amplification'" to measure how a design feature biases the voice of an
opinion group. Our work presents a warning to not oversimplify analysis of social
media data for inferring social opinions.},

abstract = {In the past few years an unprecedented wave of anti-abortion policies were introduced
and enacted in state governments in the U.S., affecting millions of constituents.
We study this rapid spread of policy change as a function of the underlying ideology
of constituents. We examine over 200,000 public messages posted on Twitter surrounding
abortion in the year 2013, a year that saw 82 new anti-abortion policies enacted.
From these posts, we characterize people's expressions of opinion on abortion and
show how these expressions align with policy change on these issues. We detail a number
of ideological differences between constituents in states enacting anti versus pro-abortion
policies, such as a tension between the moral values of purity versus fairness, and
a differing emphasis on the fetus versus the pregnant woman. We also find significant
differences in how males versus females discuss the issue of abortion, including greater
emphasis on health and religion by males. Using these measures to characterize states,
we can construct models to explain the spread of abortion policy from state to state
and project which types of abortion policies a state will introduce. Models defining
state similarity using our Twitter-based measures improved policy projection accuracy
by 7.32% and 12.02% on average over geographic and poll-based ideological similarity,
respectively. Additionally, models constructed from the expressions of male-only constituents
perform better than models from the expressions of female-only constituents, suggesting
that the ideology of men is more aligned with the recent spread of anti-abortion legislation
than that of women.},

this work, we expand the elicitation method to between-subjects designs. We introduce
a new measure for evaluating coagreement between groups and a new statistical test
for agreement rate analysis that reports the exact p-value to evaluate the significance
of the difference between agreement rates calculated for independent groups. We show
the usefulness of our tools by re-examining previously published gesture elicitation
data, for which we discuss significant differences in agreement for technical and
non-technical participants, men and women, and different acquisition technologies.
Our new tools will enable practitioners to properly analyze their user-elicited data
resulted from complex experimental designs with multiple independent groups and, consequently,
will help them understand agreement data and verify hypotheses about agreement at
more sophisticated levels of analysis.},

SHMGs are suitable for the mobile and discrete nature of interactions for ubiquitous

gestures. We performed a user-elicitation study with 16 participants to determine
their preferred gestures for a set of referents. We contribute an analysis of 1,632
gestures, the resulting gesture set, and prevalent conceptual themes amongst the elicited
gestures. These themes provide a set of guidelines for gesture designers, while informing
the designs of future studies. With the increase in hand-tracking and electronic devices
in our surroundings, we see this as a starting point for designing gestures suitable
to portable ubiquitous computing.},

consistent with an implicit role -- but did not agree on which role to implicitly

of unfairness. We carried out a study to test how disclosing skill assistance affects
player experience. We found -- surprisingly -- that disclosing assistance did not
harm play experience; players were more influenced by the benefits of equalized performance
resulting from assistance than by their knowledge of the assist. We introduce the
idea of attribution biases to help explain why awareness was not harmful -- people
tend to take credit for their successes, but attribute failures externally. We discuss
how game designers can incorporate skill assistance to build multiplayer games that

Whereas there are development environments that help end users create and debug software,
there is currently little analogous support for physical computing tasks. Our work
is a first step towards building appropriate tools that support end-user developers

source code history is navigated on the granularity of individual files. This is not
fine-grained enough to support users in exploring the evolution of individual code
elements. We suggest to consider the history of individual elements within the tree
structure inherent to source code. A history graph created from these trees then enables
new ways to explore events of interest defined by structural changes in the source
code. We present Tree Flow, a visualization of these structural changes designed to
enable users to choose the appropriate level of detail for the task at hand. In a
user study, we show that both Chronicler and the history aware timeline, two prototype
systems combining history graph navigation with a traditional source code view, outperform
the more traditional history navigation on a file basis and users strongly prefer
Chronicler for the exploration of source code.},

to allow continuous text inspection, and suffixes to speed up typing with word prediction.
AugKey limits the visual information to the foveal region to minimize eye movements
(i.e., reduce eye work). We have applied AugKey to a dwell-time keyboard and compared
its performance with two conditions with no augmented feedback: a keyboard with and
one without word prediction. Results show that AugKey can be about 28% faster than
no word prediction and 20% faster than traditional word prediction, with a smaller
workload index.},

learn from others and sustain participation in organized activities. Through this

accessible to and owned by all stakeholders, and that facilitates productive dialogues
among them. Our discussion is grounded firstly in work with end users, in which problematic
language emerged as a key barrier to participation and effective design. Three specific
categories of language barriers are identified: jargon, ambiguity, and emotive words.
Building on this we undertook a workshop and focus group, respectively involving researchers
developing smart health technologies and users, where the focus was on generating
a shared language. We discuss this process, including examples that emerged of alternative
terminology and specific strategies for creating a shared language.},

The purpose of this investigation is to understand how parent-child relationships
in families shape co-design processes and how they are reshaped through co-design.
We document the evolutionary process and outcomes that exist in co-design partnerships
between researchers and families. We found that parents' engagement patterns shifted
more slowly than that of children's from observing and facilitating to design partnering
practices. Our analysis suggests the importance of establishing and nurturing social
bonds among parents, children, and researchers in the co-design process.},

argument for exploring tactile interactions as rich as visual displays. Direct Manipulation
underlies much of the advances in visual interactions. In this work, we introduce
the concept of a Direct Manipulation-enabled Tactile display (DMT). We define the
concepts of a tactile screen, tactile pixel, tactile pointer, and tactile target which
enable tactile pointing, selection and drag &amp; drop. We build a proof of concept tactile
display and study its precision limits. We further develop a performance model for
DMTs based on a tactile target acquisition study. Finally, we study user performance
in a real-world DMT menu application. The results show that users are able to use
the application with relative ease and speed.},

been suggested. With a virtual touch screen, the user's direct-touch interactions
are allowed in much the same way as a conventional touch screen, but the absence of

this issue, we developed a wearable haptic device, called HapThimble. It provides
various types of haptic feedback (tactile, pseudo-force, and vibrotactile) to the
user's fingertip and mimics physical buttons based on force-penetration depth curves.
We conducted three experiments with HapThimble. The first experiment confirmed that
HapThimble could increase a users' performance when conducting clicking and dragging
tasks. The second experiment revealed that users could differentiate between six types
of haptic feedback, rendered based on different force-penetration depth curves obtained
using HapThimble. Last, we conducted a test to investigate the similarity between
the physical buttons and the mimicked haptic buttons and obtained a 90.3% success

abstract = {Current mobile devices do not leverage the rich haptic channel of information that
our hands can sense, and instead focus primarily on touch based graphical interfaces.
Our goal is to enrich the user experience of these devices through bi-directional
haptic and tactile interactions (display and control) around the edge of hand-held
devices. We propose a novel type of haptic interface, a Haptic Edge Display, consisting
of actuated pins on the side of a display, to form a linear array of tactile pixels
(taxels). These taxels are implemented using small piezoelectric actuators, which
can be made cheaply and have ideal characteristics for mobile devices. We developed
two prototype Haptic Edge Displays, one with 24 actuated pins (3.75mm in pitch) and
a second with 40 pins (2.5mm in pitch). This paper describes several novel haptic
interactions for the Haptic Edge Display including dynamic physical affordances, shape
display, non-dominant hand interactions, and also in-pocket ``pull' style haptic notifications.
In a laboratory experiment we investigated the limits of human perception for Haptic
Edge Displays, measuring the just-noticeable difference for pin width and height changes
for both in-hand and simulated in-pocket conditions.},

abstract = {The most common method of presenting tactile stimuli to touch screens has been to
directly attach a tactile display to the screens. This requires a transparent tactile
display so that the view is not obstructed. In contrast, transparency is not required
if the tactile stimuli are presented on the back of the device. However, stimulating
the entire palm is not appropriate because touch screens are typically used by only
one finger. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method in which tactile
feedback is delivered to a single finger on the back of a touch screen. We used an
electro-tactile display because it is small and dense. The tactile display presents
touch stimuli as mirror images of the shapes on the touch screen. By comparing cases
in which the device was operated by one or two hands, we found that shape discrimination
is possible using this method.},

about how free-form gestures perform in the wild. We present the first field study
(N=91) of mobile authentication using free-form gestures, with text passwords as a
baseline. Our study leveraged Experience Sampling Methodology to increase ecological
validity while maintaining control of the experiment. We found that, with gesture
passwords, participants generated new passwords and authenticated faster with comparable
memorability while being more willing to retry. Our analysis of the gesture password
dataset indicated biases in user-chosen distribution tending towards common shapes.

methods at once: While PIN entry enables full access to the device, users can also
bypass authentication with a short sliding gesture ("Snap"). This grants access for
a limited amount of time (e.g. 30 seconds). The device then automatically locks itself
upon expiration. Our concept further explores limiting the possible number of Snaps
in a row, and configuring blacklists for app use during short access (e.g. to exclude
banking apps). We discuss opportunities and challenges of this concept based on a
30-day field study with 18 participants, including data logging and experience sampling
methods. Snaps significantly reduced unlock times, and our app was perceived to offer
a good tradeoff. Conceptual challenges include, for example, supporting users in configuring
their blacklists.},

abstract = {We present TableHop, a tabletop display that provides controlled self-actuated deformation
and vibro-tactile feedback to an elastic fabric surface while retaining the ability
for high-resolution visual projection. The surface is made of a highly stretchable
pure spandex fabric that is electrostatically actuated using electrodes mounted on
its top or underside. It uses transparent indium tin oxide electrodes and high-voltage
modulation to create controlled surface deformations. Our setup actuates pixels and
creates deformations in the fabric up to +/- 5 mm. Since the electrodes are transparent,
the fabric surface functions as a diffuser for rear-projected visual images, and avoid
occlusion by users or actuators. Users can touch and interact with the fabric to experience
expressive interactions as with any fabric based shape-changing interface. By using
frequency modulation in the high-voltage circuit, it can also create localized tactile
sensations on the user's fingertip when touching the surface. We provide simulation
and experimental results for the shape of the deformation and frequency of the vibration
of the surface. These results can be used to build prototypes of different sizes and
form-factors. We present a working prototype of TableHop that has 30x40 cm2 surface
area and uses a grid of 3x3 transparent electrodes. It uses a maximum of 9.46 mW and
can create tactile vibrations of up to 20 Hz. TableHop can be scaled to make large
interactive surfaces and integrated with other objects and devices. TableHop will
improve user interaction experience on 2.5D deformable displays.},

are correlated with arousal level. In several cases, symbolic shape expressions based

were able to recognize emotions given a shape with a good accuracy within 28% of the

optimizes the internal routing of the sensing elements and computes a mapping from

experiment to study the relationship between content intimacy and willingness to self-disclose
in social media, and how identification (real name vs. anonymous) and audience type
(social ties vs. people nearby) moderate that relationship. Content intimacy is known
to regulate self-disclosure in face-to-face communication: people self-disclose less
as content intimacy increases. We show that such regulation persists in online social
media settings. Further, although anonymity and an audience of social ties are both
known to increase self-disclosure, it is unclear whether they (1) increase self-disclosure
baseline for content of all intimacy levels, or (2) weaken intimacy's regulation effect,
making people more willing to disclose intimate content. We show that intimacy always
regulates self-disclosure, regardless of settings. We also show that anonymity mainly
increases self-disclosure baseline and (sometimes) weakens the regulation. On the
other hand, an audience of social ties increases the baseline but strengthens the
regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that anonymity has a more salient effect on content
of negative valence.The results are critical to understanding the dynamics and opportunities
of self-disclosure in social media services that vary levels of identification and

malicious sellers in order to appear more reputable than appropriate. We conducted
a controlled experiment with 40 UK and 41 German participants on their ability to
detect malicious behavior by means of an eBay-like feedback profile versus a novel
interface involving an interactive visualization of reputation data. The results show
that participants using the new interface could better detect and understand malicious
behavior in three out of four attacks (the overall detection accuracy 77% in the new
vs. 56% in the old interface). Moreover, with the new interface, only 7% of the users
decided to buy from the malicious seller (the options being to buy from one of the
available sellers or to abstain from buying), as opposed to 30% in the old interface
condition.},

or seek support when they need it. One such stigmatized context for support seeking
is sexual abuse. In this paper, we use mixed methods to understand abuse-related posts
on reddit. First, we take a qualitative approach to understand post content. Then
we use quantitative methods to investigate the use of "throwaway" accounts, which
provide greater anonymity, and report on factors associated with support seeking and
first-time disclosures. In addition to significant linguistic differences between
throwaway and identified accounts, we find that those using throwaway accounts are
significantly more likely to engage in seeking support. We also find that men are
significantly more likely to use throwaway accounts when posting about sexual abuse.
Results suggest that subreddit moderators and members who wish to provide support
pay attention to throwaway accounts, and we discuss the importance of context-specific
anonymity in support seeking.},

games. While research has explored how autonomy is afforded by a game's design, little
is known about the role of the social context of play. Particularly, engaging with
serious games or gamified applications is often obligatory, which may thwart autonomy.
To tease out contextual factors that affect autonomy, we conducted a qualitative interview
study that compared game-play experience in leisure and work contexts. We found that
leisure contexts, particularly solitary play, support autonomy through a time and
space shielded from outer demands, the license to (dis)engage with and configure the
situation to fit one's spontaneous interests, and a lack of social and material consequence.
Thwarted autonomy occurs both in leisure and work contexts when players' spontaneous
interests mismatch socially demanded gameplay. We discuss implications for entertainment
and applied gaming.},

Manikin, comments elicited with Cued-Recall Debrief, galvanic skin responses (GSR)
and gaze data. Two empirical studies involving a search task with a website known
to have UPs were conducted to substantiate findings and improve on the methodological
framework, which could facilitate usability evaluation practice. Results showed no
correlation between GSR peaks and severity ratings, but GSR peaks were correlated
with frustration scores -- a metric we developed. The Peak-End rule was partially
verified. The problematic evaluator effect was the limitation as it confounded the
severity ratings of UPs. Future work is aimed to control this effect and to develop
a multifaceted severity scale.},

affect on initial adoption, retention, and overall user experience. Through an iterative
process, we have developed a model for user burden that consists of six constructs:
1) difficulty of use, 2) physical, 3) time and social, 4) mental and emotional, 5)
privacy, and 6) financial. If researchers and practitioners can have an understanding
of the overall level of burden systems may be having on the user, they can have a
better sense of whether and where to target future design efforts that can reduce
those burdens. To help assist with understanding and measuring user burden, we have
also developed and validated a measure of user burden in computing systems called
the User Burden Scale (UBS), which is a 20-item scale with 6 individual sub-scales
representing each construct. This paper presents the process we followed to develop
and validate this scale for use in evaluating user burden in computing systems. Results
indicate that the User Burden Scale has good overall inter-item reliability, convergent
validity with similar scales, and concurrent validity when compared to systems abandoned

is to reduce mental workload and error rates. Whilst most assessment of mental workload
is subjective and retrospective reporting by users, we examine the potential of functional
Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a tool for objectively and concurrently measuring
mental workload during usability testing. We use this technology to evaluate the design
of three different form layouts for a car insurance claim process, and show that a
form divided into subforms increases mental workload, contrary to our expectations.
We conclude that fNIRS is highly suitable for objectively examining mental workload
during usability testing, and will therefore be able to provide more detailed insight
than summative retrospective assessments. Further, for the fNIRS community, we show
that the technology can easily move beyond typical psychology tasks, and be used for
more natural study tasks.},

fiction that are usually included within the content of 'real' research papers, they

findings. Design fiction abstracts have been proposed as a means to move beyond solutionism
to explore the potential societal value and consequences of new HCI concepts. In this
paper we contrast the properties of imaginary abstracts, with the properties of a
published paper that presents fictional research, Game of Drones. Extending the notion
of imaginary abstracts so that rather than including fictional abstracts within a 'non-fiction' research paper, Game of Drones is fiction from start to finish (except
for the concluding paragraph where the fictional nature of the paper is revealed).
In this paper we review the scope of design fiction in HCI research before contrasting
the properties of imaginary abstracts with the properties of our example fictional
research paper. We argue that there are clear merits and weaknesses to both approaches,
but when used tactfully and carefully fictional research papers may further empower
HCI's burgeoning design discourse with compelling new methods.},

with practitioners in a range of companies, with differing levels of expertise and
educational backgrounds represented. Interviewees were asked about their use of design
methods in practice, and the methods they considered to be core of their practice;
in addition, they were asked what set of methods would be vital for beginning designers
joining their company. Based on these interviews, I evaluate practitioner conceptions
of design methods, proposing an appropriation-oriented mindset that drives the use
of tool knowledge, supporting designers' practice in a variety of corporate contexts.
Opportunities are considered for future research in the study of UX practice and training
of students in human-computer interaction programs.},

to bring staff "into the loop" of understanding and managing heating, and so reduce
energy waste. The display was deployed for three weeks in five public libraries. Analysis
of interaction logs, questionnaires and interviews shows that staff used the displays
to understand heating in their buildings, and took action reflecting this new understanding.
Bringing together our results, we discuss design implications for workplace displays,
and an analysis of carbon emissions generated in constructing and operating our design.

consumption, and the potential for the HCI community to engage with its application,

how positive and negative cues of a provider's effort and expertise affected perceived

primarily when the cues were negative. The results also showed that effort cues affected
perceived quality as much as expertise. In a second study, we explored the use of
behavioral data for modeling effort for feedback tasks. For a binary classification,
the models achieved up to 92% accuracy relative to human raters. This result validates
the feasibility of implementing effort cues in crowd services. The contributions of

economic research to examine whether payment in bulk after every ten tasks, saving
money via coupons instead of earning money, or material goods rather than money will
increase the number of completed tasks. We perform a twenty-day, between-subjects
field experiment (N=300) on a mobile crowdsourcing application and measure how often
workers responded to a task notification to fill out a short survey under each incentive
condition. Task completion rates increased when paying in bulk after ten tasks: doing
so increased the odds of a response by 1.4x, translating into 8% more tasks through
that single intervention. Payment with coupons instead of money produced a small negative
effect on task completion rates. Material goods were the most robust to decreasing
participation over time.},

To this end, the present work directly compared the impact of various "emphasis frames,"
highlighting distinct intrinsic motivational factors, used to describe an online game
in which players provide descriptive metadata "tags" for digitized images. An initial
study showed that, compared to frames emphasizing personal enjoyment or altruistic
motivations, a frame emphasizing a "growing community of players" solicited significantly
fewer contributions. A second study tested the hypothesis that this lower level of
contribution resulted from social loafing (the tendency to exert less effort in collective
tasks in which contributions are anonymous and pooled). Results revealed that, compared
to a no-frame control condition, a frame emphasizing the preponderance of other players
reduced contribution levels and game replay likelihood, whereas a frame emphasizing
the scarcity of fellow players increased contribution and replay levels. Various strategies
for counteracting social loafing in crowdsourcing contexts are discussed.},

design space and automatically select the optimal design configuration. Our present
focus is on the optimization of a game design space. The results of our experiments
show that bandits can make data-driven design more efficient and accessible to interface
designers, but that human participation is essential to ensure that AI systems optimize
for the right metric. Based on our results, we introduce several design lessons that
help keep human design judgment in the loop. We also consider the future of human-technology
teamwork in AI-assisted design and scientific inquiry. Finally, as bandits deploy
fewer low-performing conditions than typical experiments, we discuss ethical implications
for bandits in large-scale experiments in education.},

propose the Anchored Customization approach, which anchors settings to conceptually
related elements of the application UI. Our Customization Layer prototype instantiates
this approach: users can see which UI elements are customizable, and access their
associated settings. We designed three variants of Customization Layer based on multi-layered
interfaces, and implemented these variants on top of a popular web application for
task management, Wunderlist. Two experiments (Mechanical Turk and face-to-face) with
a total of 60 participants showed that the two minimalist variants were 35% faster
than Wunderlist's settings panel. Our approach provides significant benefits for users
while requiring little extra work from designers and developers of applications.},

touch patterns with tokens of varying shape and size. The analysis of this pattern
collection showed that individual users have a consistent grasp for each token, but
that this grasp is user-dependent and that different grasp strategies can lead to
confounding patterns. We thus designed a second set of tokens featuring notches that
constrain users' grasp. Our recognition algorithm can classify the resulting patterns

most reliably and rapidly produced area touches. We report generally positive user
reactions to these demonstrators: the area touch interactions were perceived as quick,
convenient and easy to learn and remember. Together this work characterizes how designers
can use area touches in watch UIs, which area touches are most appropriate and how
users respond to this interaction style.},

reasonable target sizes for specific fingers and two-finger chords, and a relative
ranking of the suitability of fingers and two-finger chords for common multi-touch
tasks. Our work contributes new knowledge regarding specific finger and chord performance
and can inform the design of future interaction techniques and interfaces utilizing

The results are used to develop a computer vision algorithm to identify fingers and

is built into a background service to enable system-wide finger-aware shortcut keys
in any application. A controlled experiment uses the service to compare the performance
of Finger-Aware Shortcuts with existing methods. The results show Finger-Aware Shortcuts
are comparable with a common class of shortcuts using multiple modifier keys. Finally,
application demonstrations illustrate different use cases and mappings for Finger-Aware

as team members attempt to coordinate with each other without distraction to achieve
victory. Some games enable this communication through "pings," alerts that are easy
to activate and provide auditory and visual cues for teammates. In this paper, we
review the literature on gestures and non-verbal communication and, through an empirical
analysis of 84,489 players across 10,293 matches in the popular game, League of Legends,
illustrate ping use in multiplayer games and test the impact of ping actions on performance
in teams. We show that the amount of pings depends on player role and in-game activity
and that pings by players have a positive but concave relationship with player performance.
These findings demonstrate the importance of non-verbal communication and interruption
on the performance of virtual team members. We conclude by discussing the implications
of these results for theorizing and designing sociotechnical systems that rely on
users to engage in synchronous, collaborative work in shared visual spaces.},

dilemma between selecting roles that best match their experience and roles that best

how players negotiate this dilemma. Using data from League of Legends, we define a
similarity space to operationalize team design constructs about role proficiency,
generality, and congruency. We collect publicly available data from 3.36 million players
to test the influence of these constructs on team performance. We also conduct focus
groups with novice and elite players to understand how players' team design practices
vary with expertise. We find that the two factors, player proficiency and team congruency,
both increase team performance, with the former having a stronger impact. We also
find that elite players are better at balancing the two factors than the novice players.
These findings have implications for players, designers, and theorists about how to
recommend team designs that jointly prioritize individuals' expertise and teams' compatibility.},

of digital devices in recent years. Their ability to express information in a universal
fashion allows us to immediately interact with new applications, systems, and devices.
Icons can, however, cause user confusion and frustration if designed poorly. Several
studies have evaluated icons using behavioral-performance metrics such as reaction
time as well as self-report methods. However, determining the usability of icons based
on behavioral measures alone is not straightforward, because users' interpretations
of the meaning of icons involve various cognitive processes and perceptual mechanisms.
Moreover, these perceptual mechanisms are affected not only by the icons themselves,
but by usage scenarios. Thus, we need a means of sensitively and continuously measuring
users' different cognitive processes when they are interacting with icons. In this
study, we propose an EEG-based approach to icon evaluation, in which users' EEG signals
are measured in multiple usage scenarios. Based on a combination of EEG and behavioral
results, we provide a novel interpretation of the participants' perception during
these tasks, and identify some important implications for icon design.},

that thermal stimulation increased valence and arousal in images with low valence
and neutral to low arousal. Thermal augmentation of images also reduced valence and
arousal in high valence and arousal images. We discovered that depending on when thermal
augmentation is presented, it can either be used to create anticipation or enhance
the inherent emotion an image is capable of evoking.},

However, developers faced with technical limitations or cost constraints that prevent

that system response delays will have on user engagement. In this work, we demonstrate
a methodology for using crowd sourcing platforms to examine (1) the relative impacts
of different delay types and (2) the effects of marginal changes in system response
times. We compare two common network delay types, those caused by limited bandwidth
(increased download times) and those caused by network latency (lag in responsiveness),
and present how these delays reduce engagement in the context of a crowd sourced image
classification task. Furthermore, we model how financial incentives interact with
system response delays to impact user engagement. Finally, we show how such models
can be used to optimize the cost of system design choices.},

abstract = {In recent years, the HCI community has recognized the need to address long(er) term
information system design around on-going societal problems. Yet how to engage stakeholders
effectively in multi-lifespan design thinking remains an open challenge. Toward that
end, the work reported here extends an established envisioning method by introducing
two new design methods, the multi-lifespan timeline and multi-lifespan co-design,
with an emphasis on the element of (long) time. The new methods aim to stimulate participants'
visions of future information systems by: (a) enhancing participants' understanding
of longer timeframes (e.g., 100 years), and (b) guiding participants to effectively
project themselves long into the future in their design thinking. We explored these
multi-lifespan design methods in work with 51 Africans from Rwanda and the Great Lakes
region living in the USA to understand the challenges and opportunities they envision
for designing future information systems for transitional justice in Rwanda. Contributions
are two-fold: (1) methodological innovation, and (2) a case study of multi-lifespan
design thinking generated by diaspora members of post-conflict societies.},

interactive installations. Building on the concept of interaction gestalt, we define
the participation gestalt as the unified perception and experience of participatory
qualities as they unfold through interaction with the installation in a socio-cultural
setting. The framework consists of five continua, mapping out the qualities of participation
in relation to the degree of expressivity, exposure, investment, sociality and persistence
that people experience when engaging in the interaction. Individually, the five qualities
provide a vocabulary for analyzing an interactive installation. Combined, the five
qualities constitute a participation gestalt framework by which HCI researchers can
qualify how a certain forms of participation emerge around public installations. We
exemplify the framework by analyzing four public installations in different socio-cultural
contexts and examining their participation gestalt.},

those challenges in the development of accessible, empowering movement-based games,

asking participants for their help in design. Instead, participatory design is a set
of methods and practices used to scaffold the design experience, increasing participants'
reflection of their own knowledge and accounting for their previous knowledge so they
can more fully engage in the design process. This active reflection and considerations
of pervious experiences are closely tied to metacognition and a number of learning
theories. Exploring previous studies provides examples of how learning theories are
enacted through participatory design and how a greater awareness of these theories
can inform the practice of participatory design.},

This paper describes a field study investigating how clinicians make a heart pump

intelligence, as well as many barriers to computer use at the point of clinical decision-making.
These findings suggest an alternative perspective to the traditional use models, in
which clinicians engage with DSTs at the point of making a decision. We identify situations
across patients' healthcare trajectories when decision supports would help, and we
discuss new forms it might take in these situations.},

collected from 38 users in their natural environment to discover patterns of stress
in real life. We find that the duration of a prior stress episode predicts the duration
of the next stress episode and stress in mornings and evenings is lower than during
the day. We then analyze the relationship between stress and objectively rated disorder
in the surrounding neighborhood and develop a model to predict stressful episodes.},

notion of striving towards one's personal best. It remains unclear, however, what
this distinction offers to UX research conceptually and empirically. We investigate
a possible role for eudaimonia in UX research by empirically examining 266 reports
of positive experiences with technology and analyzing its relation to established
UX concepts. Compared to hedonic experiences, eudaimonic experiences were about striving
towards and accomplishing personal goals through technology use. They were also characterized
by increased need fulfillment, positive affect, meaning, and long-term importance.
Taken together, our findings suggest that while hedonic UX is about momentary pleasures
directly derived from technology use, eudaimonic UX is about meaning from need fulfilment.},

abstract = {A core tradition of HCI lies in the experimental evaluation of the effects of techniques
and interfaces to determine if they are useful for achieving their purpose. However,
our individual analyses tend to stand alone, and study results rarely accrue in more
precise estimates via meta-analysis: in a literature search, we found only 56 meta-analyses
in HCI in the ACM Digital Library, 3 of which were published at CHI (often called
the top HCI venue). Yet meta-analysis is the gold standard for demonstrating robust
quantitative knowledge. We treat this as a user-centered design problem: the failure
to accrue quantitative knowledge is not the users' (i.e. researchers') failure, but
a failure to consider those users' needs when designing statistical practice. Using
simulation, we compare hypothetical publication worlds following existing frequentist
against Bayesian practice. We show that Bayesian analysis yields more precise effects
with each new study, facilitating knowledge accrual without traditional meta-analyses.
Bayesian practices also allow more principled conclusions from small-n studies of
novel techniques. These advantages make Bayesian practices a likely better fit for
the culture and incentives of the field. Instead of admonishing ourselves to spend
resources on larger studies, we propose using tools that more appropriately analyze
small studies and encourage knowledge accrual from one study to the next. We also
believe Bayesian methods can be adopted from the bottom up without the need for new
incentives for replication or meta-analysis. These techniques offer the potential
for a more user- (i.e. researcher-) centered approach to statistical analysis in HCI.},

crowdfunding, potential donors can no longer rely on the organization's traditional
methods for achieving credibility. Individual fundraisers must establish credibility

of crowdfunding campaigns. In this paper, we investigate current practices in assessing
the credibility of online medical crowdfunding campaigns. We report results from a
mixed-methods study that analyzed data from social media and semi-structured interviews.
We discovered eleven factors associated with the perceived credibility of medical
crowdfunding. Of these, three communicative/emotional factors were unique to medical
crowdfunding. We also found a distinctive validation practice, the collective endorsement.
Close-connections' online presence and external online communities come together to
form this collective endorsement in online medical fundraising campaigns. We conclude
by describing how fundraisers can leverage collective endorsements to improve their
campaigns' perceived credibility.},

projects reduce the likelihood that other projects are funded by the crowd, even when
the super project has no opportunity to steal away donations form other projects.
We argue that this is due to superstar projects setting too high of a standard of
what a "fundable" project looks like, leading donors to underestimate the amount of
support within a crowd for less exceptional projects.},

tool for workers in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), built by the authors and maintained

as creative innovators and AMT workers as without agency or capacity to change their
situation. We argue that designers' elevated status as workers in knowledge economies
can have practical consequences for the politics of their design work. We explain
the consequences of this status for Turkopticon and how we adapted our approach in
response over the long term. We argue for analyses of power in design work that account
for and develop counters to hegemonic beliefs and practices about design as high-status

abstract = {We present a sketching tool for crafting animated illustrations that contain the exaggerated
dynamics of stylized 2D animations. The system provides a set of motion amplifiers
which implement a set of established principles of 2D animation. These amplifiers
break down a complex animation effect into independent, understandable chunks. Each
amplifier imposes deformations to an underlying grid, which in turn updates the corresponding
strokes. Users can combine these amplifiers at will when applying them to an existing
animation, promoting rapid experimentation. By leveraging the freeform nature of sketching,
our system allows users to rapidly sketch, record motion, explore exaggerated dynamics
using the amplifiers, and fine-tune their animations. Practical results confirm that
users with no prior experience in animation can produce expressive animated illustrations
quickly and easily.},

We reviewed the visual qualities of icons that could make them noticeable and likable.
We then computationally measured two of the qualities visual saliency and complexity
for 930 icons and linked the computed scores to app popularity (the number of app
ratings and installs). The measures explained 38% of variance in the number of ratings,
if app genre was accounted for. Not only does such result assert the link between
icon properties and app popularity, it also highlights the automatic prediction of
app popularity as a promising research direction. HCI researchers, app creators and
Google Play (or another mobile marketplace) will benefit from the paper insights on
what antecedes app success and how to measure the antecedents.},

abstract = {OPAC interfaces, still the dominant access point to library catalogs, support systematic
search but are problematic for open-ended exploration and generally unpopular with
visitors. As a result, libraries start subscribing to simplified search paradigms
as exemplified by web-search systems. This is a problem considering that systematic
search is a crucial skill in the light of today's abundance of digital information.
Inspired by novel approaches to facilitating search, we designed CollectionDiver,
an installation for supporting systematic search in public libraries. The CollectionDiver
combines tangible and large display direct-touch interaction with a visual representation
of search criteria and filters. We conducted an in-situ qualitative study to compare
participants' search approaches on the CollectionDiver with those on the OPAC interface.
Our findings show that while both systems support a similar search process, the CollectionDiver
(1) makes systematic search more accessible, (2) motivates proactive search approaches
by (3) adding transparency to the search process, and (4) facilitates shared search
experiences. We discuss the CollectionDiver's design concepts to stimulate new ideas
toward supporting engaging approaches to systematic search in the library context
and beyond.},

when one has to do it frequently for example, when notifications keep interrupting
one's current task. We introduce Peek-a-View, a fully transparent flipping screen
cover that can reduce task switching overhead by providing an additional virtual screen
space for subtasks. We assessed its feasibility in handling notifications. Upon receiving
a notification, users can peek into the content of the notification without actually
switching apps by slightly lifting the cover. If necessary, users can completely flip
the cover to switch to the app that fired the notification. Two user studies showed
that flipping and peeking interaction provided improved performance and proved to
be useful for tasks that involve subtasks.},

that both techniques are feasible, able to accommodate large numbers of commands,

techniques. We also provide insights into the types of applications for which these

However, current designs require several actions to make a selection, and they do
not provide shortcuts for users who have become familiar with the toolbar. To better
understand the performance capabilities and tradeoffs involved in hidden toolbars,
we outline a design space that captures the key elements of these controls, and report
on an empirical evaluation of four designs. Two of our designs provide shortcuts that
are based on the user's spatial memory of item locations. The study found that toolbars
with spatial-memory shortcuts had significantly better performance (700ms faster)
than standard designs currently in use. Participants quickly learned the shortcut
selection method (although switching to a memory-based method led to higher error
rates than the visually-guided techniques). Participants strongly preferred one of
the shortcut methods that allowed selections by swiping across the screen bezel at
the location of the desired item. This work shows that shortcut techniques are feasible
and desirable on touch devices, and shows that spatial memory can provide a foundation
for designing shortcuts.},

in average post-selection feedback can reduce touch error rates by 78.4%, with a compromise
of target acquisition time no more than 10%. In addition, we investigate participants'
adjustment behavior based on correlation between successive trials. We conclude that
the benefit of post-selection feedback is the outcome of both improved understanding
about finger/point mapping and the dynamic adjustment of finger movement enabled by
the visualization of the touch point.},

in their analysis. To validate this assumption, we conducted a field study where we
collected user-labelled activity data through ESM and sensor logging. Our results
indicate that for the majority of instances where users return to their smartphone,
i.e., unlock their device, they in fact begin a new session as opposed to continuing
a previous one. Our findings suggest that the commonly used approach of ignoring brief
standby periods is not reliable, but optimisation is possible. We therefore propose
various metrics related to usage sessions and evaluate various machine learning approaches
to classify gaps in usage.},

a gift economy, emphasizing a special relationship enacted through crafted self-presentation.
However, gift exchange makes up only a small proportion of conversation. Many participants
struggled with the self-presentation obligations of video when attempting more everyday
conversation. Faced with the 'tyranny of the everyday', many participants reverted
to other systems where content forms reflected more lightweight exchange. We argue
that designing for fluid control of the obligations of turn exchange is key to mobile
applications intended to support everyday messaging.},

have the option of enabling a "lock screen" that requires a secret code (e.g., PIN,

analysis of the smartphone locking mechanisms currently available to billions of smartphone
users worldwide. Through a month-long field study, we logged events from a panel of
users with instrumented smartphones (N=134). We are able to show how existing lock
screen mechanisms provide users with distinct tradeoffs between usability (unlocking
speed vs. unlocking frequency) and security. We find that PIN users take longer to
enter their codes, but commit fewer errors than pattern users, who unlock more frequently
and are very prone to errors. Overall, PIN and pattern users spent the same amount
of time unlocking their devices on average. Additionally, unlock performance seemed
unaffected for users enabling the stealth mode for patterns. Based on our results,
we identify areas where device locking mechanisms can be improved to result in fewer
human errors -- increasing usability -- while also maintaining security.},

already been put into the reliable and accurate automatic detection of emotions, only
very little is known about how this information about affective states should be displayed
in a comprehensible way to the user. In the present study, three newly developed feedback
tools were evaluated. The tools were developed on the basis of an existing non-verbal
questionnaire to represent two dimensions of emotion (i.e. valence and arousal) based
on the circumplex model of affect. A total number of 826 participants were tested,
using different vignettes that describe situations with specific affective content.
Employing three newly developed affective feedback tools (AniSAM, AniAvatar and MergedSAM),
the ratings obtained were compared to ratings using the original SAM instrument, a
well-established questionnaire to measure affect. Results indicated that the animated
feedback increased the accuracy of the arousal representation. Furthermore, valence
feedback was more accurate when provided with an animated manikin-based tool rather
than an avatar-based tool. This provided first evidence for the usefulness of animated
tools offering visual feedback on user emotion. All instruments need to undergo further
development. AniSAM and AniAvatar can be downloaded for purposes of practical applications
and further research.},

thermal feedback to models of emotion that could be used by designers and users to
convey a range of emotions in HCI. A common way of classifying emotions and quantifying
emotional experience is through ratings along valence and arousal dimensions, originating
from Russell's circumplex model [32]. Therefore, the research in this paper mapped
subjective ratings of a range of thermal stimuli to the circumplex model to understand
the range of emotions that might be conveyed through thermal feedback. However, as
the suitability of the model varies depending on the type of emotional stimuli [31],
we also compared the goodness of fit of ratings between the circumplex and vector
[8,31] models of emotion. The results showed that thermal feedback was interpreted
as representing a limited range of emotions concentrated in just two quadrants or
categories of the circumplex: high valence, low arousal and low valence, high arousal.
Warm stimuli were perceived as more pleasant/positive than cool stimuli and altering
either the rate or extent of temperature change affected both valence and arousal
axes simultaneously. The results showed a significantly better fit to a vector model
than to the circumplex.},

of turns-at-talk remains troublesome throughout the encounter, as evidenced by overlapping
turns and lengthy silences around possible turn endings. The study discusses how the
robot design can be improved to support the problematic taking of turns-at-talk with
humans. Two programming strategies to address the identified problems are presented:
1. to program the robot so that it will be systematically receptive at the equivalence
to transition relevance places in human-human interaction, and 2. to make the robot
preferably produce verbal actions that require a response in a conditional way, rather

research as problem-solving. We build on the philosophy of Larry Laudan, who develops
problem and solution as the foundational concepts of science. We argue that most HCI
research is about three main types of problem: empirical, conceptual, and constructive.
We elaborate upon Laudan's concept of problem-solving capacity as a universal criterion
for determining the progress of solutions (outcomes): Instead of asking whether research
is 'valid' or follows the 'right' approach, it urges us to ask how its solutions advance
our capacity to solve important problems in human use of computers. This offers a
rich, generative, and 'discipline-free' view of HCI and resolves some existing debates

abstract = {Much of the academic and commercial work which seeks to innovate around technology
has been dismissed as "solutionist" because it solves problems that don't exist or
ignores the complexity of personal, political and environmental issues. This paper
traces the "solutionism" critique to its origins in city planning and highlights the
original concern with imaging and representation in the design process. It is increasingly
cheap and easy to create compelling and seductive images of concept designs, which
sell solutions and presume problems. We consider a range of strategies, which explicitly
reject the search for "solutions". These include design fiction and critical design
but also less well-known techniques, which aim for unuseless, questionable and silly
designs. We present two examples of "magic machine" workshops where participants are
encouraged to reject realistic premises for possible technological interventions and
create absurd propositions from lo-fi materials. We argue that such practices may
help researchers resist the impulse towards solutionism and suggest that attention
to representation during the ideation process is a key strategy for this.},

is not yet formalised, and there are ongoing debates about fundamental issues, such
as how to articulate and evaluate knowledge that springs from RtD, and how this knowledge
is comparable to knowledge from other forms of research. I propose that Rheinberger's
conceptualisation of experimental systems, originally developed in the domain of the
natural sciences, offers insights that can add to the understanding of these issues,
and in turn to the development of RtD as a research approach. I examine key characteristics
of experimental systems as they pertain to RtD, with a focus on the role of designs
and forms of knowledge representation. I furthermore propose that the experimental
systems perspective can shed light on similarities and differences between RtD and
other research approaches.},

Furthermore, as financially vulnerable workers in the informal sector, concerns about

they do not necessarily deliver [57]. We describe how Ola does little to change the
uncertainty which characterizes an auto drivers' day. This leads us to consider how
a more equitable and inclusive system might be designed.},

domain specific design requirements for visualizing uncertainty in transit prediction

transit application, and 3) an iterative design process. We present several candidate
visualizations of uncertainty for realtime transit predictions in a mobile context,
and we propose a novel discrete representation of continuous outcomes designed for
small screens, quantile dotplots. In a controlled experiment we find that quantile
dotplots reduce the variance of probabilistic estimates by ~1.15 times compared to
density plots and facilitate more confident estimation by end-users in the context

drivers make interacting with an infotainment system. In this study, participants
(N = 46) drove a stimulated vehicle and performed word entry tasks on a touch screen.
Errors undermined driving and task performance. We also identified four different
error recovery strategies and found that the accumulated information related to the
driving situation and the characteristics of an infotainment system affected the choice
of strategy. Implications for in-vehicle interface design, driver models, and general
multitasking design are discussed.},

SymmetriSense achieves typical accuracies at sub-centimeter levels in our localization

capabilities to existing mobile phones. It combines an e-paper display with a pressure-
and bend-sensitive input sensor to augment the capabilities of a phone. Due to the
form factor, FlexCase can be easily transformed into several different configurations,
each with different interaction possibilities. Users can use FlexCase to perform a
variety of touch, pressure, grip and bend gestures in a natural manner, much like
interacting with a sheet of paper. The secondary e-paper display can act as a mechanism
for providing user feedback and persisting content from the main display. In this
paper, we explore the rich design space of FlexCase and present a number of different
interaction techniques. Beyond, we highlight how touch and flex sensing can be combined
to support a novel type of gestures, which we call Grip &amp; Bend gestures. We also describe
the underlying technology and gesture sensing algorithms. Numerous applications apply
the interaction techniques in convincing real-world examples, including enhanced e-paper
reading and interaction, a new copy and paste metaphor, high degree of freedom 3D

abstract = {We introduce TapBoard 2, a touchpad-based keyboard that solves the problem of typing
and pointing disambiguation. The pointing interaction design of TapBoard 2 is nearly
identical to natural touchpad interaction, and its shared workspace naturally invites
bimanual pointing interaction. To implement TapBoard 2, we developed a novel gesture
representation scheme for a systematic design and gesture recognizer. A user evaluation
showed that TapBoard 2 successfully supports collocated pointing and typing interaction.
It was able to disambiguate typing and pointing actions with an accuracy of greater
than 95%. In addition, the typing and pointing performance of TapBoard 2 were comparable
to that of a separate keyboard and mouse. In particular, the bimanual pointing operations
of TapBoard 2 are highly efficient and strongly favored by participants.},

abstract = {We present PACE, a Personalized, Automatically Calibrating Eye-tracking system that
identifies and collects data unobtrusively from user interaction events on standard
computing systems without the need for specialized equipment. PACE relies on eye/facial
analysis of webcam data based on a set of robust geometric gaze features and a two-layer
data validation mechanism to identify good training samples from daily interaction
data. The design of the system is founded on an in-depth investigation of the relationship
between gaze patterns and interaction cues, and takes into consideration user preferences
and habits. The result is an adaptive, data-driven approach that continuously recalibrates,
adapts and improves with additional use. Quantitative evaluation on 31 subjects across
different interaction behaviors shows that training instances identified by the PACE
data collection have higher gaze point-interaction cue consistency than those identified
by conventional approaches. An in-situ study using real-life tasks on a diverse set
of interactive applications demonstrates that the PACE gaze estimation achieves an
average error of 2.56º, which is comparable to state-of-the-art, but without the need
for explicit training or calibration. This demonstrates the effectiveness of both
the gaze estimation method and the corresponding data collection mechanism.},

a physical workspace and visualize them onto the space by a projector or through an
optical see-through head-mounted display. Through a series of user studies, we have
found the followings: 1) Eye fixations can serve as a fast and precise pointer to
objects of the collaborator's interest. 2) Eyes and other modalities, such as hand
gestures and speech, are used differently for object identification and manipulation.
3) Eyes are used for explicit instructions only when they are combined with speech.
4) The worker can predict some intentions of the collaborator such as his/her current
interest and next instruction.},

abstract = {Using real time eye tracking, gaze-contingent displays can modify their content to
represent depth (e.g., through additional depth cues) or to increase rendering performance
(e.g., by omitting peripheral detail). However, there has been no research to date
exploring how gaze-contingent displays can be leveraged for manipulating perceived
color. To address this, we conducted two experiments (color matching and sorting)
that manipulated peripheral background and object colors to influence the user's color
perception. Findings from our color matching experiment suggest that we can use gaze-contingent
simultaneous contrast to affect color appearance and that existing color appearance
models might not fully predict perceived colors with gaze-contingent presentation.
Through our color sorting experiment we demonstrate how gaze-contingent adjustments
can be used to enhance color discrimination. Gaze-contingent color holds the promise
of expanding the perceived color gamut of existing display technology and enabling
people to discriminate color with greater precision.},

abstract = {The paper contributes a novel technique that can improve user performance in skim
reading. Users typically use a continuous-rate-based scrolling technique to skim works
such as longer Web pages, e-books, and PDF files. However, visual attention is compromised
at higher scrolling rates because of motion blur and extraneous objects with overly
brief exposure times. In response, we present Spotlights. It complements the regular
continuous technique at high speeds (2--20 pages/s). We present a novel design rule
informed by theories of the human visual system for dynamically selecting objects
and placing them on transparent overlays on top of the viewer. This improves the quality
of visual processing at high scrolling rates by 1) limiting the number of objects,
2) ensuring minimal processing time per object, and 3) keeping objects static to avoid
motion blur and facilitate gaze deployment. Spotlights was compared to continuous
scrolling in two studies using long documents (200+ pages). Comprehension levels for
long documents were comparable with those in continuous-rate-based scrolling, but
Spotlights showed significantly better scrolling speed, gaze deployment, recall, lookup
performance, and user-rated comprehension.},

directly by the users or combined from other services. Although users are aware of
the latter, it is unclear whether they are comfortable with such data combination,
whether they view it as beneficial for them, or the extent to which they believe that
their privacy is exposed. Through an online survey (N=918) and follow-up interviews
(N=14), we show that (1) comfort is highly dependent on the type of data, type of
service and on the existence of a direct relationship with a company, (2) users have
a highly different opinion about the presence of benefits for them, irrespectively
of the context, and (3) users perceive the combination of online data as more identifying
than data related to offline and physical behavior (such as location). Finally, we
discuss several strategies for companies to improve upon these issues.},

and similarities between users. While past researchers have clustered users into different
groups, past categories of users have proven to be poor predictors of end-user behaviors.
In this paper, we perform an alternative clustering of users based on their behaviors.
Through the analysis of data from surveys and interviews of participants, we identify
five user clusters that emerge from end-user behaviors-Fundamentalists, Lazy Experts,
Technicians, Amateurs and the Marginally Concerned. We examine the stability of our
clusters through a survey-based study of an alternative sample, showing that clustering
remains consistent. We conduct a small-scale design study to demonstrate the utility
of our clusters in design. Finally, we argue that our clusters complement past work
in understanding privacy choices, and that our categorization technique can aid in
the design of new computer security technologies.},

made apparently contradictory statements. The same issue could evoke concern or not
in the span of an interview, sometimes even a single sentence. Drawing on dual-process
theories from psychology, we argue that some of the apparent contradictions can be
resolved if privacy concern is divided into two components we call intuitive concern,
a "gut feeling," and considered concern, produced by a weighing of risks and benefits.
Consistent with previous explanations of the so-called privacy paradox, we argue that
people may express high considered concern when prompted, but in practice act on low
intuitive concern without a considered assessment. We also suggest a new explanation:
a considered assessment can override an intuitive assessment of high concern without
eliminating it. Here, people may choose rationally to accept a privacy risk but still
express intuitive concern when prompted.},

even though they have consented to such tracking by hitting the "I Agree" button on
the application's end user license agreement (EULA). This is because most users do
not read the EULA carefully. The language and presentation of EULAs are often dull,
dense and inaccessible. Researchers have proposed design options for heightening comprehension
of EULA content, but the effectiveness of these suggestions is unclear. To address
this gap, we conducted an experiment that examined how users' attitudes towards EULAs
are affected by paraphrased and forced EULA formats. Paraphrased EULA presentations
increased the time spent on reading the EULA. Moreover, they elicited more positive
attitudes toward the EULA, which in turn predicted better comprehension. These findings
hold implications for design of EULAs by showing that complex content displayed in
simple terms across multiple windows can increase reader comprehension.},

could therefore be useful for predicting users' computer security behaviors. We performed
three experiments to identify correlations between each of SeBIS's four sub-scales
and relevant computer security behaviors. We found that testing high on the awareness
sub-scale correlated with correctly identifying a phishing website; testing high on
the passwords sub-scale correlated with creating passwords that could not be quickly
cracked; testing high on the updating sub-scale correlated with applying software
updates; and testing high on the securement sub-scale correlated with smartphone lock
screen usage (e.g., PINs). Our results indicate that SeBIS predicts certain computer
security behaviors and that it is a reliable and valid tool that should be used in
future research.},
